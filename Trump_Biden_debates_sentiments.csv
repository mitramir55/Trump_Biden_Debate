mediator_1,good evening from the health education campus of case western reserve university and the cleveland clinic i’m chris wallace of fox news and i welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between president donald j trump and former vice president joe biden this debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the commission has designed the format six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question then open discussion for the rest of each segment both campaigns have agreed to these rules for the record i decided the topics and the questions in each topic i can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates,first,2
mediator_1,this debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the cleveland clinic which is serving as the health security advisor to the commission for all four debates as a precaution both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight’s debate the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent no cheers no boos or other interruptions so we and more importantly you can focus on what the candidates have to say no noise except right now as we welcome the republican nominee president trump and the democratic nominee vice president biden,first,2
Joe Biden,how you doing man,first,2
Donald Trump,how are you doing,first,2
Joe Biden,i’m well,first,3
mediator_1,gentlemen a lot of people been waiting for this night so let’s get going our first subject is the supreme court president trump you nominated amy coney barrett over the weekend to succeed the late ruth bader ginsburg on the court you say the constitution is clear about your obligation and the senate’s to consider a nominee to the court vice president biden you say that this is an effort by the president and republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power my first question to both of you tonight why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong and where do you think a justice barrett would take the court president trump in this first segment you go first two minutes,first,3
Donald Trump,thank you very much chris i will tell you very simply we won the election elections have consequences we have the senate we have the white house and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all top top academic good in every way good in every way in fact some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from notre dame and other places so i think she’s going to be fantastic we have plenty of time even if we did it after the election itself i have a lot of time after the election as you know so i think that she will be outstanding she’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court we really feel that we have a professor at notre dame highly respected by all said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had he’s been a professor for a long time at a great school,first,4
Donald Trump,and we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise and by the way the democrats they wouldn’t even think about not doing it the only difference is they’d try and do it faster there’s no way they would give it up they had merrick garland but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped and probably that would happen in reverse also definitely would happen in reverse so we won the election and we have the right to do it chris,first,3
mediator_1,president trump thank you same question to you vice president biden you have two minutes,first,2
Joe Biden,well first of all thank you for doing this and looking forward to this mr president,first,3
Donald Trump,thank you joe,first,2
Joe Biden,the american people have a right to have a say in who the supreme court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for united states senators and when they vote for the president of united states they’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already the election has already started tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the american people get to express their view is by who they elect as president and who they elect as vice president,first,2
Joe Biden,now what’s at stake here is the president’s made it clear he wants to get rid of the affordable care act he’s been running on that he ran on that and he’s been governing on that he’s in the supreme court right now trying to get rid of the affordable care act which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now if it goes into court and the justice i’m not opposed to the justice she seems like a very fine person but she’s written before she went in the bench which is her right that she thinks that the affordable care act is not constitutional the other thing that’s on the court and if it’s struck down what happens women’s rights are fundamentally changed once again a woman could pay more money because she has a preexisting condition of pregnancy they’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets,first,2
Joe Biden,and that ended when we in fact passed the affordable care act and there’s a hundred million people who have preexisting conditions and they’ll be taken away as well those preexisting conditions insurance companies are going to love this and so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election if he wins the election and the senate is republican then he goes forward if not we should wait until february,first,1
Donald Trump,there aren’t a hundred million people with preexisting conditions as far as a say is concerned the people already had their say okay justice ginsburg said very powerfully very strongly at some point 10 years ago or so she said a president and the senate is elected for a period of time but a president is elected for four years we’re not elected for three years i’m not elected for three years so we have the senate we have a president,first,2
Joe Biden,he’s elected to the next election,first,2
Donald Trump,during that period of time during that period of time we have an opening i’m not elected for three years i’m elected for four years joe the hundred million people is totally wrong i don’t know where you got that number the bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care that they’re very happy this,first,1
Joe Biden,that’s simply not true,first,2
Donald Trump,well you’re certainly going to socialist you’re going to socialist,first,2
mediator_1,gentlemen we’re now into open discussion,first,2
Joe Biden,open discussion,first,3
mediator_1,open discussion yes i agree go ahead vice president,first,3
Joe Biden,number one he knows what i proposed what i proposed is that we expand obamacare and we increase it we do not wipe any and one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that i won were saying that biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still they can they do they will under my proposal,first,2
Donald Trump,that’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying,first,1
Joe Biden,that is simply a lie,first,1
Donald Trump,your party doesn’t say it your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare,first,2
Joe Biden,the party is me right now i am the democratic party,first,3
Donald Trump,and they’re going to dominate you joe you know that,first,2
Joe Biden,i am the democratic party right now,first,2
Donald Trump,not according to harris,first,2
Joe Biden,the platform of the democratic party is what i in fact approved of what i approved of now here’s the deal the deal is that it’s going to wipe out preexisting conditions and by the way the 200000 people that have died on his watch how many of those have survived well there’s seven million people that contracted covid what does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the affordable care act,first,2
Donald Trump,joe you’ve had 308000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military so don’t tell me about this,first,1
Joe Biden,i’m happy to talk about this,first,3
Donald Trump,and if you were here it wouldn’t be 200 it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw you didn’t want me to ban china which was heavily infected you didn’t want me to ban europe,first,2
mediator_1,all right gentlemen mr president,first,2
Donald Trump,you would have been much later joe much later,first,2
mediator_1,mr president,first,2
Donald Trump,we’re talking about two million people,first,2
Joe Biden,you’re not going to be able to shut him up,first,2
mediator_1,mr president as the moderator we are going to talk about covid in the next segment but go ahead,first,2
Joe Biden,let me finish the point is that the president also is opposed to roe v wade that’s on the ballot as well and the court in the court and so that’s also at stake right now and so the election is all,first,2
Donald Trump,you don’t know what’s on the ballot why is it on the ballot why is it on the ballot it’s not on the ballot,first,1
Joe Biden,it’s on the ballot in the court,first,2
Donald Trump,i don’t think so,first,1
Joe Biden,in the court,first,2
Donald Trump,there’s nothing happening there,first,1
Joe Biden,donald would you just be quiet for a minute,first,2
Donald Trump,you don’t know her view on roe v wade you don’t know here view,first,2
mediator_1,well all right all right let’s talk we’ve got a lot to unpack here gentlemen we’ve got a lot of time on healthcare and then we’ll come back to roe v wade,first,2
Joe Biden,all right,first,2
mediator_1,mr president the supreme court will hear a case a week after the election in which the trump administration along with 18 state attorney generals are seeking to overturn obamacare to end obamacare,first,2
Donald Trump,that’s right,first,3
mediator_1,you have spent the last week,first,2
Donald Trump,because they want to give good healthcare,first,2
mediator_1,if i may ask my question sir,first,2
Joe Biden,good healthcare,first,3
mediator_1,over the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace obamacare but you have never in these four years come up with a plan a comprehensive plan to replace obamacare,first,1
Donald Trump,yes i have of course i have the individual mandate,first,2
mediator_1,crosstalk 001126 when i finish i’m going to give an opportunity,first,2
Donald Trump,excuse me i got rid of the individual mandate which was a big chunk of obamacare,first,2
mediator_1,that’s not a comprehensive place,first,1
Donald Trump,that is absolutely a big thing that was the worst part of obamacare,first,0
mediator_1,i didn’t ask sir,first,2
Donald Trump,chris that was the worst part of obamacare,first,1
mediator_1,you’re debating him not me let me ask my question,first,2
Donald Trump,well i’ll ask joe the individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of obamacare,first,2
mediator_1,mr president,first,2
Donald Trump,i got rid of it and we will protect people,first,1
mediator_1,mr president i’m the moderator of this debate and i would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer,first,2
Donald Trump,go ahead,first,2
mediator_1,you in the course of these four years have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace obamacare and just this last thursday you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with preexisting conditions five days before this debate so my question sir is what is the trump healthcare plan,first,2
Donald Trump,well first of all i guess i’m debating you not him but that’s okay i’m not surprised let me just tell you something there’s nothing symbolic i’m cutting drug prices i’m going with favored nations which no president has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90 you could have done it during your 47 year period in government but you didn’t do it nobody’s done it so we’re cutting healthcare,first,2
mediator_1,what about preexisting conditions,first,2
Donald Trump,all of the things that we’ve done,first,2
Joe Biden,he has not done healthcare,first,2
Donald Trump,i’ll give you an example insulin it was destroying families destroying people the cost i’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water you want to know the truth so cheap take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing prescription drug prices we’re going to allow our governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do,first,1
mediator_1,okay like i say this is open discussion,first,2
Donald Trump,this is big stuff,first,3
mediator_1,sir you’ll be happy i’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the vice president which is he points out that you would like to add a public option to obamacare,first,2
Joe Biden,yes,first,2
mediator_1,and the argument that he makes and other republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance,first,2
Joe Biden,it is not,first,2
mediator_1,if i start asking the question,first,2
Donald Trump,that’s not what your party says by the way,first,2
mediator_1,and it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health,first,2
Joe Biden,it does not it’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for medicaid they can get that free in most states except governors who want to deny people who are poor medicaid anyone who qualifies for medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option the vast majority of the american people would still not be in that option number one number two,first,2
Donald Trump,joe you agreed with bernie sanders who’s far left on the manifesto we call it and that gives you socialized medicine,first,2
Joe Biden,look hey,first,2
Donald Trump,are you saying you didn’t agree,first,2
Joe Biden,i’m not going to listen to him the fact of the matter is i beat bernie sanders,first,2
Donald Trump,not by much,first,2
Joe Biden,i beat him by a whole hell of a lot,first,2
Donald Trump,not by much,first,2
Joe Biden,i’m here standing facing you old buddy,first,2
Donald Trump,if pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary,first,0
Joe Biden,all he knows how to do,first,2
Donald Trump,on super tuesday you got very lucky,first,3
Joe Biden,look he’s the deal i got very lucky i’m going to get very lucky tonight as well,first,3
Donald Trump,with what,first,2
Joe Biden,and tonight i’m going to make sure,first,3
Donald Trump,with what,first,2
Joe Biden,because here’s the deal here’s the deal the fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie i’m not here to call out his lies everybody knows he’s a liar,first,1
Donald Trump,but you agree joe you’re the liar you graduated last in your class not first in your class,first,1
Joe Biden,god i want to make sure,first,2
mediator_1,mr president can you let him finish sir,first,2
Joe Biden,no he doesn’t know how to do that,first,2
Donald Trump,you’d be surprised you’d be surprised go ahead joe,first,2
Joe Biden,the wrong guy the wrong night at the wrong time,first,1
Donald Trump,listen you agreed with bernie sanders and the manifesto,first,2
Joe Biden,there is no manifesto number one,first,2
mediator_1,please let him speak mr president,first,2
Joe Biden,number two,first,2
Donald Trump,he just lost the left,first,1
Joe Biden,number two,first,2
Donald Trump,you just lost the left you agreed with bernie sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan crosstalk 001510 they call it socialized medicine,first,1
mediator_1,mr president,first,2
Joe Biden,i’ll tell you what he is not for any help for people needing healthcare,first,2
Donald Trump,who is bernie,first,2
Joe Biden,because he in fact already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession number one number two there are 20 million people getting healthcare through obamacare now that he wants to take it away he won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do take it away,first,2
Donald Trump,no i want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price because obamacare is no good,first,1
Joe Biden,he doesn’t know how he doesn’t know how to do that,first,2
Donald Trump,i’ve already fixed it,first,1
Joe Biden,he has never offered a plan,first,2
Donald Trump,we’ve already fixed it to an extent obamacare as you might know but probably don’t obamacare is no good,first,1
mediator_1,gentlemen you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time let the president go ahead sir,first,2
Donald Trump,obamacare is no good we made it better and i had a choice to make very early on we took away the individual mandate we guaranteed preexisting conditions but took away the individual mandate listen this is the way it is and that destroyed … they shouldn’t even call it obamacare then i had a choice to make do i let my people run it really well or badly if i run it badly they’ll probably blame him but they’ll blame me but more importantly i want to help people okay i said “you’ve got to run it so well” and i just had a meeting with them they said the problem is no matter how well you run obamacare it’s a disaster it’s too expensive premiums are too high that it doesn’t work so we do want to get rid of it chris we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better,first,1
mediator_1,i understand that sir but i have to give you roughly equal time,first,2
Donald Trump,go ahead,first,2
mediator_1,please let the vice president talk sir,first,2
Donald Trump,good,first,3
Joe Biden,he has no plan for healthcare,first,1
Donald Trump,of course we do,first,2
mediator_1,please,first,2
Joe Biden,he sends out wishful thinking he has executive orders that have no power he hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody he’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected he has none like almost everything else he talks about he does not have a plan he doesn’t have a plan and the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about crosstalk 001714,first,1
mediator_1,all right i have one final question for you,first,2
Joe Biden,sure,first,2
mediator_1,mr vice president if senate republicans we were talking originally about the supreme court here if senate republicans go ahead and confirm justice barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court adding to the nine justices there you call this a distraction by the president but in fact it wasn’t brought up by the president it was brought up by some of your democratic colleagues in the congress so my question to you is you have refused in the past to talk about it are you willing to tell the american tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court,first,2
Joe Biden,whatever position i take on that that’ll become the issue the issue is the american people should speak you should go out and vote you’re voting now vote and let your senators know strongly how you feel,first,3
Donald Trump,are you going to pack the court,first,2
Joe Biden,vote now,first,2
Donald Trump,are you going to pack the court,first,2
Joe Biden,make sure you in fact let people know your senators,first,2
Donald Trump,he doesn’t want to answer the question,first,2
Joe Biden,i’m not going to answer the question,first,2
Donald Trump,why wouldn’t you answer that question you want to put a lot of new supreme court justices radical left,first,2
Joe Biden,will you shut up man,first,1
Donald Trump,listen who is on your list joe who’s on your list,first,2
mediator_1,gentlemen i think we’ve ended this,first,2
Joe Biden,this is so unpresidential,first,1
Donald Trump,he’s going to pack the court he is not going to give a list,first,2
mediator_1,we have ended the segment we’re going to move on to the second segment,first,2
Joe Biden,that was really a productive segment wasn’t it keep yapping man,first,3
Donald Trump,the people understand joe,first,2
Joe Biden,they sure do,first,2
Donald Trump,47 years you’ve done nothing they’re understand,first,2
mediator_1,all right the second subject is covid19 which is an awfully serious subject so let’s try to be serious about it we have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the united states and more than 200000 people have died even after we produce a vaccine experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal my question for both of you is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021 why should the american people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward in this case the question goes to you first sir two minutes uninterrupted,first,2
Joe Biden,good luck 200000 dead as you said over seven million infected in the united states we in fact have 4 of the world’s population 20 of the deaths 40000 people a day are contracting covid in addition to that about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying when he was presented with that number he said “it is what it is” well it is what it is because you are who you are that’s why it is the president has no plan he hasn’t laid out anything he knew all the way back in february how serious this crisis was he knew it was a deadly disease what did he do he’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it he said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the american people you don’t panic he panicked in addition to that what did he do,first,2
Joe Biden,he went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in china should be able to go to wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was he did not even ask xi to do that,first,2
Donald Trump,wrong,first,1
Joe Biden,he told us what a great job xi was doing he said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us and what did he do then he then did nothing he waited and waited and waited he still doesn’t have a plan,first,1
Donald Trump,wrong,first,1
mediator_1,sir it’s his two minutes,first,2
Donald Trump,it’s so wrong,first,1
Joe Biden,i laid out back in march exactly what we should be doing and i laid out again in july what we should be doing we should be providing all the protective gear possible we should be providing the money the house has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open open schools cost a lot of money you should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the oval office and bring together the democrats and republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives,first,2
Donald Trump,so if we would have listened to you,first,2
mediator_1,wait wait you have two minutes sir,first,2
Donald Trump,if we would’ve listened to you the country would have been left wide open millions of people would have died not 200000 and one person is too much it’s china’s fault it should have never happened they stopped it from going in but it was china’s fault and by the way when you talk about numbers you don’t know how many people died in china you don’t know how many people died in russia you don’t know how many people died in india they don’t exactly give you a straight count just so you understand but if you look at what we’ve done i closed it and you said “he’s xenophobic he’s a racist and he’s xenophobic” because you didn’t think i should have closed our country wait a minute,first,1
mediator_1,sir it’s his two minutes,first,2
Donald Trump,you didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible you wouldn’t have closed it for another two months by my doing it early in fact dr fauci said “president trump saved thousands of lives” many of your democrat governors said “president trump did a phenomenal job” we worked with the governor oh really go take a look the governors said i did a phenomenal job most of them said that in fact people that would not be necessarily on my side said that “president trump did a phenomenal job” we did we got the gowns we got the masks we made the ventilators you wouldn’t have made ventilators and now we’re weeks away from a vaccine we’re doing therapeutics already fewer people are dying when they get sick far fewer people are dying we’ve done a great job,first,3
Donald Trump,the only thing i haven’t done a good job and that’s because of the fake news no matter what you say to them they give you a bad press on it it’s just fake news they give you good press they give me bad press because that’s the way it is unfortunately but let me just say something i don’t care i’ve gotten used to it but i’ll tell you joe you could never have done the job that we did you don’t have it in your blood you could’ve never done that joe,first,1
Joe Biden,i know how to do the job i know how to get the job done,first,3
Donald Trump,well you didn’t do very well in swine flu h1n1 you were a disaster your own chief of staff said you were a disaster,first,0
Joe Biden,14000 people died not 200000,first,2
Donald Trump,a far less lethal disease by the way,first,2
mediator_1,sir you made a point let him answer it,first,2
Joe Biden,and there was no one … we didn’t shut down the economy this is his economy he shut down the reason it’s shut down is because look you folks at home how many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of covid how many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye,first,2
Donald Trump,we would have lost far more people far more people you would have been months late you’re months behind me joe,first,2
Joe Biden,his own cdc director says we could lose as many as another 200000 people between now and the end of the year and he said if we just wear a mask we can save half those numbers just a mask and by the way in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine we’re for a vaccine but i don’t trust him at all nor do you i know you don’t what we trust is a scientist,first,2
Donald Trump,you don’t trust johnson johnson pfizer,first,1
mediator_1,okay gentlemen gentlemen let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions i’m going to ask focusing on the future first president trump you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists the week before last the head of the centers for disease control dr redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public you said that he was confused and mistaken those were your two words but dr slaoui the head of your operation warp speed has said exactly the same thing are they both wrong,first,2
Donald Trump,well i’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner it’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives,first,1
Joe Biden,god,first,2
Donald Trump,it is a very political thing i’ve spoken to pfizer i’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to moderna johnson johnson and others they can go faster than that by a lot it’s become very political because the left… or i don’t know if i call them left i don’t know what i call them,first,2
mediator_1,so you’re suggesting that the head of your operation warp speed dr slaoui,first,2
Donald Trump,i disagree with him no i disagree with both of them and he didn’t say that he said it could be there but it could also be much sooner i had him in my office two days ago,first,1
mediator_1,he talked about the summer sir before it’s generally available just like dr redfield,first,2
Donald Trump,because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before november 1st it could also be after that,first,2
mediator_1,i’m talking about when it’s generally available not,first,2
Donald Trump,well we’re going to deliver it right away we have the military all set up logistically they’re all set up we have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200000 a day they’re going to be delivering,first,2
Joe Biden,this is the same man who told you,first,2
Donald Trump,it’s all set up,first,2
Joe Biden,… by easter this would be gone away by the warm weather it’d be gone miraculous like a miracle and by the way maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it this is the same man,first,1
Donald Trump,that was said sarcastically and you know that that was said sarcastically,first,1
Joe Biden,so here’s the deal this man is talking about a vaccine every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out if we get the vaccine and pray god we will pray god we will,first,2
mediator_1,mr vice president i want to pick up,first,3
Donald Trump,you’ll have the vaccine sooner than that,first,2
mediator_1,i want to pick up on this question though you say the public can trust the scientists but they can’t trust president trump in fact you said that again tonight your running mate senator harris goes further saying that public health experts quote “will be muzzled will be suppressed” given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it are you and your running mate senator harris contributing to that fear,first,2
Joe Biden,no more than the question you just asked him you pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists,first,2
mediator_1,but you’re saying you can’t,first,2
Joe Biden,everybody knows,first,2
mediator_1,or senator harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist,first,2
Joe Biden,well no no you can trust the scientist she didn’t say that you can trust the,first,2
mediator_1,she said that public health experts quote “will be muzzled will be suppressed”,first,2
Joe Biden,yes well that’s what he’s going to try to do but there’s thousands of scientists out there like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him their job doesn’t depend on him they’re the people… and by the way,first,2
Donald Trump,we spoke to the scientists that are in charge,first,2
Joe Biden,by the way,first,2
Donald Trump,… they will have the vaccine very soon,first,2
mediator_1,let him finish,first,2
Joe Biden,do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to covid he still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening knew how dangerous it was going to be back in february and he didn’t even tell you he’s on record as saying it he panicked or he just looked at the stock market one of the two because guess what a lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter a lot quicker,first,2
mediator_1,mr president,first,2
Donald Trump,did you use the word smart so you said you went to delaware state but you forgot the name of your college you didn’t go to delaware state you graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class don’t ever use the word smart with me don’t ever use that word,first,0
Joe Biden,oh give me a break,first,1
Donald Trump,because you know what there’s nothing smart about you joe 47 years you’ve done nothing,first,0
Joe Biden,well let’s have this debate,first,2
Donald Trump,let me just tell you something joe if you would have had the charge of what i was put through i had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country and by the way now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast,first,2
mediator_1,we’ll get to the economy in the next segment sir,first,2
Donald Trump,okay it’s going up fast i look forward to talking about it,first,3
mediator_1,okay when it comes to how the virus has been handled so far the two of you have taken very different approaches and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president i want to quickly go through several of those reopenings vice president biden you have been much more reluctant than president trump about reopening the economy and schools why sir,first,2
Joe Biden,because he doesn’t have a plan if i were running it i’d know what the plan is you’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the ppe as well as with the sanitation they need you have to provide them classic,first,1
Donald Trump,tell that to nancy pelosi,first,2
Joe Biden,will he just shush for a minute,first,1
Donald Trump,tell that to nancy pelosi and schumer crosstalk 000452 chuck,first,2
Joe Biden,nancy pelosi and schumer they have a plan he won’t even meet with them the republicans won’t meet in the senate he sits in his golf course well i mean literally think about it think about it,first,2
Donald Trump,you probably play more than i do joe,first,2
mediator_1,what about this question of reopenings and the fact,first,2
Donald Trump,well he wants to shut down this country and i want to keep it open and we did a great thing by shutting it down,first,2
Joe Biden,you just admitted you’d shut it down,first,1
Donald Trump,wait a minute joe let me shut you down for a second joe just for one second he wants to shut down the country we just went through it we had to because we didn’t know anything about the disease now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very very vulnerable we learned a lot young children aren’t even younger people aren’t we’ve learned a lot but he wants to shut it down more people will be hurt by continuing if you look at pennsylvania if you look at certain states that have been shut down they have democrat governors all one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on november 3rd,first,2
mediator_1,all right i want to move onto another,first,2
Donald Trump,because it’s a political thing,first,2
mediator_1,i want to move onto another subject,first,1
Joe Biden,i got to respond to that,first,2
mediator_1,i want to move,first,3
Donald Trump,but those states,first,2
mediator_1,gentlemen i want to move onto another subject,first,1
Donald Trump,those states are not doing well that are shut down right now,first,1
Joe Biden,i got to respond to that,first,2
Donald Trump,he wants to shut down the whole country,first,2
mediator_1,president trump you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer and in fact recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates are you questioning the efficacy of masks,first,2
Donald Trump,no i think masks are okay you have to understand if you look… i mean i have a mask right here i put a mask on when i think i need it tonight as an example everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to but i wear masks,first,2
Joe Biden,just like your rally,first,2
Donald Trump,… when needed when needed i wear masks,first,2
mediator_1,okay let me ask,first,2
Donald Trump,i don’t wear a mask like him every time you see him he’s got a mask he could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask i’ve ever seen i will say this,first,3
mediator_1,vice president biden go ahead sir,first,2
Joe Biden,look the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open we provided money the,first,2
mediator_1,but i was asking you sir about masks,first,2
Joe Biden,well masks make a big difference his own head of the cdc said if we just wore masks between now if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and january we’d probably save up to 100000 lives it matters it matters,first,3
Donald Trump,and they’ve also said the opposite they’ve also said,first,2
Joe Biden,no serious person has said the opposite no serious person,first,2
mediator_1,okay i want to ask you,first,2
Donald Trump,dr fauci dr fauci said the opposite,first,2
Joe Biden,he did not say the opposite,first,2
mediator_1,i want to ask you we’ve got a little than a minute left in this segment,first,2
Donald Trump,he said very strongly “masks are not good” then he changed his mind he said “masks are good”,first,2
mediator_1,i want to ask,first,2
Donald Trump,i’m okay with masks i’m not fighting masks,first,2
mediator_1,i want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned president trump you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together thousands of people,first,2
Donald Trump,outside,first,2
mediator_1,outside yes sir agreed vice president biden you are holding much smaller events with,first,2
Donald Trump,because nobody will show up,first,1
mediator_1,… people with masks,first,2
Donald Trump,well it’s true nobody shows up to his rallies,first,1
mediator_1,all right in any case why you holding the big rallies why you not you go first sir,first,2
Donald Trump,because people want to hear what i have to say i mean,first,2
mediator_1,but are not worried about us spreading disease,first,2
Donald Trump,… i’m doing my job as a president and i’ll have 25 35000 people show up at airports we use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people,first,2
mediator_1,are you not worried about the disease issues sir,first,2
Donald Trump,well so far we have had no problem whatsoever it’s outside that’s a big difference according to the experts we do them outside we have tremendous crowds as you see and literally on 24 hours notice and joe does the circles and has three people someplace,first,3
Joe Biden,by the way did you see one of the last big rallies he had a reporter came up to him to ask him a question he said “no no no stand back put on your mask put on a mask have you been tested i’m way far away from those other people” that’s what he said “i’m going to be okay” he’s not worried about you he’s not worried about the people out there crosstalk 000848,first,2
Donald Trump,we’ve had no negative effect,first,3
Joe Biden,no negative effect come on,first,2
Donald Trump,we’ve had no negative effect and we’ve had 35 40000 people at these rallies,first,3
mediator_1,all right do you want to just quickly finish up because i want to move on to our next,first,2
Joe Biden,yes i would he’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks basically encouraged them not to he’s a fool on this,first,0
Donald Trump,if you could get the crowds you would have done the same thing but you can’t nobody cares,first,1
mediator_1,gentlemen can we move on to the,first,2
Donald Trump,no cares,first,2
mediator_1,gentlemen can we move on to the economy,first,2
Donald Trump,yes,first,2
mediator_1,the economy is i think it’s fair to say recovering faster than expected from the shutdown,first,3
Donald Trump,much faster,first,2
mediator_1,… in the second quarter the unemployment rate fell to 84 last month the federal reserve says the hit to growth which is going to be there is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected president trump you say we are in a vshaped recovery vice president biden you say it’s more of a kshape what difference does that mean to the american people in terms of the economy president trump in this segment you go first,first,2
Donald Trump,so we built the greatest economy in history we closed it down because of the china plague when the plague came in we closed it down which was very hard psychologically to do he didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong again two million people would be dead now instead of… still 204000 people is too much one person is too much should have never happened from china but what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business we had 104 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce that’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before and he wants to close down the… he will shut it down again he will destroy this country,first,2
Donald Trump,a lot of people between drugs and alcohol and depression when you start shutting it down you take a look at what’s happening at some of your democratrun states where they have these tough shutdowns and i’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it one of them came out last week you saw that “oh we’re going to open up on november 9th” why november 9th because it’s after the election they think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed they’re hurting people people know what to do they can social distance they can wash their hands they can wear masks they can do whatever they want but they got to open these states up,first,2
Donald Trump,when you look at north carolina when you look and these governors are under siege pennsylvania michigan and a couple of others you got to open these states up it’s not fair you’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison and you look at what’s going on with divorce look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs it’s a very very sad thing and he’ll close down the whole country this guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country our country is coming back incredibly well setting records as it does it we don’t need somebody to come in and say “let’s shut it down”,first,2
mediator_1,all right your two minutes sir we’re now moved to you as i said posing the question the president says it’s a vshape recovery you say it’s a kshaped recovery what’s the difference,first,2
Joe Biden,the difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the covid crisis have done very well billionaires have made another 300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal and he only focused on the market but you folks at home you folks living in scranton and claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in america how well are you doing this guy paid a total of 750 in taxes,first,2
Donald Trump,that’s wrong,first,1
mediator_1,sir wait no sir,first,2
Donald Trump,crosstalk 001219,first,2
mediator_1,yeah i understand you’ve agreed to the two minutes so please let him have it,first,3
Joe Biden,do i get my time back the fact is that he has in fact worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the united states to leave office having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president fewer jobs than when he became president first one in american history,first,1
Joe Biden,secondly the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines those people who have been saving our lives those people who have been out there dying people who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it and the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in america with a significant increase in covid deaths and covid cases in the united states of america and he wants to open it up more why is he want to open it up why does he take care of the… you can’t fix the economy until you fix the covid crisis and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety,first,2
Joe Biden,schools why aren’t schools open because it costs a lot of money to open them safely they were going to give his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks and then they decided no couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency not a national emergency they’ve done nothing to help small businesses nothing they’re closing one in six is now gone he ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the american people so we can open safely,first,1
mediator_1,all right your time is up sir we are going to get to,first,2
Donald Trump,i have to respond to that,first,2
mediator_1,well you both had two minutes sir,first,2
Donald Trump,excuse me he made a statement,first,2
mediator_1,and so did you,first,2
Donald Trump,no people want their schools open they don’t want to be shut down they don’t want their state shut down they want their restaurants i look at new york it’s so sad what’s happening in new york it’s almost like a ghost town and i’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to new york people want their places open they want to get back to their lives,first,2
Joe Biden,people want to be safe,first,2
Donald Trump,they’ll be careful but they want their schools open,first,2
Joe Biden,people want to be safe,first,2
Donald Trump,i’m the one that brought back football by the way i brought back big ten football it was me and i’m very happy to do it,first,4

Joe Biden,when,first,2
Donald Trump,but let me just tell you,first,2
Joe Biden,in crosstalk 001604,first,2
Donald Trump,chris let me just say something that it was the tax laws i don’t want to pay tax before i came here i was a private developer i was a private business people like every other private person unless they’re stupid they go through the laws and that’s what it is he passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits we build the building and we get tax credits like the hotel on pennsylvania avenue which by the way was given to me by the obama administration if you can believe that now the man got fired right after that happened but that’s,first,2
mediator_1,vice president biden you want to respond,first,2
Joe Biden,yeah i do want to respond look the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… he says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code and he does take advantage of the tax code that’s why i’m going to eliminate the trump tax cuts and i’m going to eliminate those tax cuts,first,2
Donald Trump,that’s okay,first,2
Joe Biden,and make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help people out there need help,first,3

Donald Trump,he has none,first,2
mediator_1,… if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government big taxes big spending i want to focus first on the taxes you propose more than 4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than 400000 a year,first,2
mediator_1,… on individuals making more than 400000 a year and on corporations president trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession,first,2
Joe Biden,well just take a look at what is the analysis done by wall street firms points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years number one and number two it would create an additional 1 trillion in economic growth because it would be about buying american the federal government spends 600 billion a year on everything from ships to steel to buildings and the like and under my proposal we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company,first,2
mediator_1,but respectfully sir i’m talking about taxes not spending,first,2
Joe Biden,by the way i’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes i’m going to make the corporate tax 28 it shouldn’t be 21 you have 91 companies federal i mean the fortune 500 who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars,first,1

mediator_1,we have six segments we have ended that segment we’re going to go to the next segment in that segment you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments in those two interrupted minutes mr president you can say anything you want i’m going to ask a question about race but if you want to answer about something else go ahead but i think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions i’m appealing to you sir to do that,first,2
Donald Trump,well and him too,first,2
mediator_1,well frankly you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has,first,1
Donald Trump,well that’s all right but he does plenty,first,3

Donald Trump,he does plenty,first,2
mediator_1,no less than you have let’s please continue on the issue of rice vicepresident biden you say that president trump’s response to the violence in charlottesville three years ago when he talked about very fine people on both sides was what directly led you to launch this run for president,first,2
Donald Trump,oh yeah sure,first,2
mediator_1,president trump you have often said that you believe you will have done more for black americans than any president with the possible exception of abraham lincoln,first,3

Joe Biden,it’s about equity and equality it’s about decency it’s about the constitution and we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone equality for the whole of america but we’ve never accomplished it but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done it is true the reason i got in the race is when those people… close your eyes remember what those people look like coming out of the fields carrying torches their veins bulging just spewing antisemitic bile and accompanied by the ku klux klan a young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought he said “there were very fine people on both sides” no president’s ever said anything like that crosstalk 002710,first,2

Joe Biden,… second point i’d make to you is that when floyd was killed when mr floyd was killed there was a peaceful protest in front of the white house what did he do he came out of his bunker had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a bible and then what happened after that the bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace the general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people not unite people at all this is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racists hatred racist division,first,2
Joe Biden,this is a man who in fact you talk about helping africanamericans one in 1000 african americans has been killed because of the coronavirus and if he doesn’t do something quickly by the end of the year one in 500 will have been killed one in 500 african americans this man is as a savior of africanamericans this man cares at all this man’s done virtually nothing look the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about you have to look at what he did and what he did has been disastrous for the africanamerican community,first,3
Donald Trump,so,first,2
mediator_1,president trump you have two minutes why should americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues,first,1
Donald Trump,you did a crime bill 1994 where you call them super predators africanamericans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it they’ve never forgotten it,first,2
Joe Biden,i’ve never said,first,2
mediator_1,no no sir it’s his two minutes,first,2
Donald Trump,so you did that and they call you a super predator and i’m letting people out of jail now that you have treated the africanamerican population community you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country you did the 1990… and that’s why if you look at the polls i’m doing better than any republican has done in a long time because they saw what you did you call them super predators and you’ve called them worse than that because you look back at your testimony over the years you’ve called them a lot worse than that as far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals total support law enforcement almost every law enforcement group in the united states i have florida i have texas i have ohio i have every… excuse me portland the sheriff just came out today and he said “i support president trump”,first,1
Donald Trump,i don’t think you have any law enforcement you can’t even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters and why aren’t you saying those words joe why don’t you say the words law enforcement because you know what if called us in portland we would put out that fire in a half an hour but they won’t do it because they’re run by radical left democrats if you look at chicago if you look at any place you want to look seattle they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back seattle minneapolis we got it back joe because we believe in law and order but you don’t the top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by democrats and in many cases radical left and they’ve got you wrapped around their finger joe to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order and i’ll tell you what the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it,first,1
mediator_1,all right i want to return to the question of race vice president biden after the grand jury in the breonna taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide you said it raises the question “whether justice could be equally applied in america” do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country,first,2
Joe Biden,yes there is there’s systemic injustice in this country in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced but look the vast majority of police officers are good decent honorable men and women they risk their lives every day to take care of us but there are some bad apples and when they occur when they find them they have to be sorted out they have to be held accountable they have to be held accountable and what i’m going to do as president of the united states is call together an entire group of people at the white house everything from the civil rights groups to the police officers to the police chiefs and we’re going to work this out,first,2
Joe Biden,we’re going to work this out so we changed the way in which we have more transparency in when these things happen these cops aren’t happy to see what happened to george floyd these cops aren’t happy to see what happened to breonna taylor most don’t like it but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… and by the way violence in response is never appropriate never appropriate peaceful protest is violence is never appropriate,first,2
mediator_1,all right mr,first,2
Donald Trump,what is peaceful protest when they run through the middle of the town,first,2
mediator_1,president trump,first,2
Donald Trump,… and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place crosstalk 003214,first,2
Joe Biden,that is not peaceful protest,first,1
Donald Trump,no it’s not but you say it is,first,2
mediator_1,president trump i’d like to continue with the issue of race i promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment,first,3
Donald Trump,fine,first,3
mediator_1,this month your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory why did you decide to do that to end racial sensitivity training and do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country sir,first,1
Donald Trump,i ended it because it’s racist i ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane that it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military in our schools all over the place and you know it and so does everybody else and he would know it crosstalk 003302,first,1
mediator_1,what is radical about racial sensitivity training,first,2
Donald Trump,if you were a certain person you had no status in life it was sort of a reversal and if you look at the people we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas and really they were teaching people to hate our country and i’m not going to do that i’m not going to allow that to happen we have to go back to the core values of this country they were teaching people that our country is a horrible place it’s a racist place and they were teaching people to hate our country and i’m not going to allow that to happen,first,2
mediator_1,vice president biden,first,2
Joe Biden,nobody’s doing that he’s the racist,first,1
Donald Trump,you just don’t know,first,2
Joe Biden,here’s the deal i know a lot more about this crosstalk 001543,first,2
mediator_1,let him finish,first,2
Joe Biden,the fact is that there is racial insensitivity people have to be made aware of what other people feel like what insults them what is demeaning to them it’s important people know many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings but it makes a big difference it makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of selfesteem it’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people they look down their nose on people like irish catholics like me who grow up in scranton they look down on people who don’t have money they look down on people who are of a different faith they looked down on people who are a different color in fact we’re all americans the only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together there’s nothing we cannot do if we do it together we can take this on and we can defeat racism in american,first,2
mediator_1,vice president… i mean president trump sir,first,2
Donald Trump,during the obamabiden administration there was tremendous division there was hatred you look at ferguson you look at or you go to very… many places look at oakland look what happened in oakland look what happened in baltimore look what happened… frankly it was more violent than what i’m even seeing now,first,2
Joe Biden,oh my lord,first,2
Donald Trump,but the reason,first,2
Joe Biden,this is ridiculous,first,0
Donald Trump,… is that the democrats that run these cities,first,2
Joe Biden,absolutely ridiculous,first,0
Donald Trump,… don’t want to talk like you about law and order,first,2
Joe Biden,violent crime,first,2
Donald Trump,and you still haven’t mentioned are you in favor of law and order,first,2
Joe Biden,i’m in favor of law you crosstalk 003515,first,2
Donald Trump,are you in favor of law and order crosstalk 003517,first,2
mediator_1,you asked a question let him finish crosstalk 003518 let him answer,first,2
Joe Biden,law and order with justice where people get treated fairly,first,3
Donald Trump,okay,first,2
Joe Biden,and the fact of the matter is violent crime went down 17 15 in our administration it’s gone up on his watch,first,2
Donald Trump,it went down much more in ours,first,2
mediator_1,all right we’re done crosstalk 003535 mr president you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order,first,3
Donald Trump,the places we had trouble were democratic run cities,first,1
mediator_1,that’s exactly my question there has been a dramatic increase in homicides in america this summer particularly and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors but in fact there have been equivalent spikes in republican led cities like tulsa and fort worth so the question is is this really a…,first,2
mediator_1,it’s like tulsa and fort worth so the question is is this really a party issue,first,2
Donald Trump,i think as a party issue you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at chicago what’s going on in chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot if you look at new york where it’s going up like nobody’s ever seen anything the numbers are going up a 100 150 200 crime it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that it’s over with but if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone and you would see problems like you’ve never seen before,first,2
Joe Biden,he wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn,first,1
Donald Trump,oh i know suburbs so much that you,first,2
mediator_1,gentlemen wait a minute,first,2
Joe Biden,i was raised in the suburbs this is not 1950 all these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore suburbs are by and large integrated there’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice andor black and white and hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with covid they’re dying in the suburbs his failure to deal with the environment they’re being flooded they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything that’s why the suburbs are in trouble,first,2
mediator_1,i do want to talk about this issue of law and order though and in the joint recommendation that came from the bidenbernie sanders task force you talked about quote reimagining policing first of all what does reimagining policing mean and do you support if i might finish the question what does reimagining policing mean and do you support the black lives matter call for community control of policing,first,2
Joe Biden,look what i support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and i’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices as a matter of fact police local police the only one defunding in his budget calls for a 400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance they need more assistance they need when they show up for a 911 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down we have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities that’s when crime went down it didn’t go up it went down and so we have to be…,first,2
Donald Trump,that’s not what they are talking about this that’s not what it is about he’s talking about defunding the police,first,2
Joe Biden,that is not true,first,2
Donald Trump,he doesn’t have any law support he has no law enforcement,first,1
Joe Biden,that’s not true,first,2
Donald Trump,he has almost nothing oh really who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you go ahead think we have time,first,1
Joe Biden,we don’t have time to do anything,first,1
Donald Trump,no no think right now name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you,first,1
mediator_1,now gentleman i think i’m going to tell i’m going to take back the bottom line,first,2
Donald Trump,there aren’t any,first,2
mediator_1,and i want to get to another subject which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in portland oregon especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests which i think you would agree you talk about peaceful protests many of those turned into riots mr vicepresident you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable the question i have though is as the democratic nominee and earlier tonight you said that you are the democratic party right now have you ever called the democratic mayor of portland or the democratic governor of oregon and said “hey you got to stop this bring in the national guard do whatever it takes but you’d stop the days and months of violence in portland”,first,2
Joe Biden,i don’t hold public office now i am a former vice president i’ve made it clear i’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted it should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted,first,2
mediator_1,but you’ve never called for the people…,first,2
Donald Trump,he’s never done that,first,2
mediator_1,excuse me sir you had never called for the leaders in portland and in oregon to call and bring in the national guard and knock off a 100 days of riots,first,2
Joe Biden,they can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way,first,2
Donald Trump,oh really i sent in the us marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days portland didn’t do anything i sent in the us marshals they took care of business,first,2
mediator_1,go ahead sir,first,2
Joe Biden,and by the way his own former spokesperson said “riots and chaos and violence help he cause” that’s what this is all about,first,2
Donald Trump,i don’t know who said that,first,1
Joe Biden,i do,first,2
Donald Trump,who,first,2
Joe Biden,i think kellyanne conway,first,2
Donald Trump,i don’t think she said that,first,2
Joe Biden,she said that,first,2
Donald Trump,i don’t think so,first,1
Joe Biden,here’s the point the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up he doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying “let’s get everybody together figure out how to deal with this” what’s he do he just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time,first,2
mediator_1,okay and to end this button up this segment i’m going to give you a minute to answer sir you have repeatedly criticized…,first,2
Donald Trump,does it mean i have to answer his stuff,first,2
mediator_1,you have repeatedly…,first,2
Donald Trump,wait a second you have made a statement,first,2
mediator_1,you’ve been talking back and forth i’m asking you,first,2
Donald Trump,i would love to end it,first,1
mediator_1,you know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that,first,2
Donald Trump,i’ll send in the national guard it would be over that’d be no problem but i don’t want to accept the national guard,first,2
mediator_1,you have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left wing extremist groups but are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in kenosha and as we’ve seen in portland,first,2
Donald Trump,sure i’m will to do that,first,2
mediator_1,are you prepared specifically to do it,first,2
Donald Trump,i would say almost everything i see is from the left wing not from the right wing,first,2
mediator_1,but what are you saying,first,2
Donald Trump,i’m willing to do anything i want to see peace,first,3
mediator_1,well do it sir,first,2
Joe Biden,say it do it say it,first,2
Donald Trump,what do you want to call them give me a name give me a name go ahead who do you want me to condemn,first,1
mediator_1,white supremacist and rightwing militia,first,2
Donald Trump,proud boys stand back and stand by but i’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing,first,2
Joe Biden,he’s own fbi director said unlike white supremacist antifa is an idea not an organization,first,2
Donald Trump,oh you got to be kidding me,first,1
Joe Biden,… not a militia that’s what his fbi director said,first,2
Donald Trump,well then you know what he’s wrong,first,1
mediator_1,we’re done sir moving onto the next… crosstalk 004246,first,2
Donald Trump,antifa is bad,first,1
Joe Biden,every body in your administration tells you the true it’s a bad idea you have no idea about anything,first,1
Donald Trump,you know what antifa is a dangerous radical group,first,2
mediator_1,all right gentlemen we’re now moving onto the trumpbiden record,first,2
Donald Trump,and you ought to be careful of them they’ll over throw you,first,1
mediator_1,i’m going to ask a question when the president seeks a second term it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president biden you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings which is don’t compare me to the almighty compare me to the alternative and in this case sir you are the alternative looking at both of your records i’m going to ask each of you why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment president trump you’ll go first two minutes,first,2
Donald Trump,because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than i’ve done in a period of three and a half years and that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with hillary clinton where it was a whole big con job but despite going through all of these things where i had a fight both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what i’ve done the greatest before covid came in the greatest economy in history lowest unemployment numbers everything was good everything was going,first,3
Donald Trump,and by the way there was unity going to happen people were calling me for the first time in years they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened we got hit but now we’re building it back up again a rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other things a fixing of the va which was a mess under him 308000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care it was a mess and we now got a 91 approval rating at the va our vets we take care of our vets but we’ve rebuilt our military and i’ll tell you something some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term i’ll have approximately 300 federal judges and court of appeals judges 300 and hopefully three great supreme court judges justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons i’ll have so many judges because president obama and him left me 128 judges to fill,first,2
Donald Trump,when you leave office you don’t leave any judges that’s like you just don’t do that they left 128 openings and if i were a member of his party because they have a little different philosophy i’d say if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president you can’t be a good vice president but i want to thank you because it gives us almost it’ll probably be above that number by the end of this term 300 judges it’s a record,first,1
mediator_1,looking at both of your records why should voters elect you president as opposed to president trump you have two minutes uninterrupted,first,1
Joe Biden,under this president we become weaker sicker poor more divided and more violent when i was vice president we inherited a recession i was asked to fix it i did we left him a booming economy and he caused the recession with regard to being weaker the fact is that i’ve gone head to head with putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff he’s putin’s puppy he still refuses to even say anything to putin about the bounty on the heads of american soldiers,first,2
Donald Trump,you son got three and a half million dollars,first,2
Joe Biden,by the way my son…,first,2
mediator_1,wait a minute mr president your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers uninterrupted well you’re a side agreed to it and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule okay sir,first,2
Joe Biden,he never keeps his word,first,1
mediator_1,no that was a rhetorical question,first,2
Joe Biden,can you get back 30 seconds,first,2
mediator_1,yes you may have go ahead,first,2
Joe Biden,so thirdly we’re poor the billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over 3 400 billion more just since covid you in the home you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before in terms of being more violent when we were in office there were 15 less violence in america than there is today he’s president united states it’s on his watch and with regard to more divided the nation it can’t stay divided we can’t be this way and speaking of my son the way you talk about the military the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers my son was in iraq he spent a year there he got the brown star he got the conspicuous service medal he was not a loser he was a patriot and the people left behind there were heroes,first,2
Donald Trump,really,first,2
Joe Biden,and i resent,first,1
Donald Trump,are you talking hunter are you talking about hunter,first,2
Joe Biden,i’m talking about my son beau biden you’re talking about hunter,first,2
Donald Trump,i don’t know beau i know hunter hunter got thrown out of the military he was thrown out dishonorably discharged,first,1
Joe Biden,that’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged,first,2
Donald Trump,for cocaine use and he didn’t have a job until you became vice president,first,2
Joe Biden,none of that is true,first,2
Donald Trump,once you became vice president he made a fortune in ukraine in china in moscow and various other places,first,2
Joe Biden,that is not true,first,2
Donald Trump,he made a fortune and he didn’t have a job,first,2
Joe Biden,my son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem he’s overtaking it he’s fixed it he’s worked on it and i’m proud of him i’m proud of my son,first,3
Donald Trump,but why was he given tens of millions of dollars,first,1
Joe Biden,he wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars crosstalk 004823 it was all discredited,first,1
mediator_1,we’ve already been through this i think the american people would rather hear about more substantial subjects well as the moderator sir i’m going to make a judgment call here,first,1
Donald Trump,i know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of moscow,first,2
Joe Biden,that is not true that report is totally discredited,first,1
Donald Trump,why did he get it,first,1
Joe Biden,mitt romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money that report was written for political reason,first,1
mediator_1,i’d like to talk about climate change,first,2
Joe Biden,so would i,first,2
mediator_1,okay the forest fires in the west are raging now they have burned millions of acres they have displaced hundreds of thousands of people when state officials there blamed the fires on climate change mr president you said i don’t think the science knows over your four years you have pulled the us out of the paris climate accord you have rolled back a number of obama environmental records what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it,first,2
Donald Trump,i want crystal clean water and air i want beautiful clean air we have now the lowest carbon… if you look at our numbers right now we are doing phenomenally but i haven’t destroyed our businesses our businesses aren’t put out of commission if you look at the paris accord it was a disaster from our standpoint and people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well as far as the fires are concerned you need forest management in addition to everything else the forest floors are loaded up with trees dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else you drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down you’ve got to have forest management,first,3
mediator_1,what do you believe about the science of climate change sir,first,2
Donald Trump,i believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good we’re planting a billion trees the billion tree project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people,first,4
mediator_1,you believe that human pollution gas greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet,first,2
Donald Trump,i think a lot of things do but i think to an extent yes i think to an extent yes but i also think we have to do better management of our forest every year i get the call california’s burning california’s burning if that was cleaned if that were if you had forest management good forest management you wouldn’t be getting those calls in europe they live they’re forest cities they call forest cities they maintain their forest they manage their forest i was with the head of a major country it’s a forest city he said “sir we have trees that are far more they ignite much easier than california there shouldn’t be that problem” i spoke with the governor about it i’m getting along very well with the governor but i said “at some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground” that’s burning down because of a lack of management,first,2
mediator_1,but sir if you believe in the science of climate change why have you rolled back the obama clean power plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants why have you relaxed…,first,2
Donald Trump,because it was driving energy prices through the sky,first,2
Joe Biden,why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks,first,1
Donald Trump,well not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference and then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased we have the old slugs out there that are 10 12 years old if you did that the car would be safer it would be much cheaper by 3500,first,2
mediator_1,but in the case of california they have simply ignored that,first,1
Donald Trump,no but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car now by the way we’re going to see how that turns out but a lot of people agree with me many people the car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline and i’m okay with electric cars too i think i’m all for electric cars i’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in california is just crazy,first,2
mediator_1,all right vice president biden i’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record but i also want to ask you about a concern you propose 2 trillion in green jobs you talk about new limits not abolishing but new limits on fracking ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050 the president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs,first,2
Joe Biden,he’s absolutely wrong number one number two if in fact during our administration in the recovery act i was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in america no one’s going to build another oil fire plant in america they’re going to move to renewable energy number one number two we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles making sure that we can do that we’re going to put 500000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future we’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out there’s so many things that we can do…,first,1
Joe Biden,gas and oil because the heat will not be going out there’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs we can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035 not only not costing people jobs creating jobs creating millions of goodpaying jobs not 15 bucks an hour but prevailing wage by having a new infrastructure that in fact is green and the first thing i will do i will rejoin the paris accord i will join the paris accord because with us out of it look what’s happening it’s all falling apart and talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy the rainforests of brazil are being torn down are being ripped down more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the united states instead of doing something about that i would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with 20 billion and say “here’s 20 billion stop tearing down the forest and if you don’t then you’re going to have significant economic consequences”,first,3
mediator_1,what about the argument that president trump basically says that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests and he’s drawn his line,first,2
Joe Biden,well he hasn’t drawn a line he wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem you can now emit more methane without it being a problem methane this is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now this is the guy who says that the fact that,first,2
Donald Trump,not true not true,first,1
Joe Biden,it’s all true and here’s the deal,first,2
Donald Trump,he’s talking about the green new deal and it’s not 2 billion crosstalk 005545 or 20 billion as you said crosstalk 005546 it’s 100 trillion,first,2
Joe Biden,i’m talking about the biden plan crosstalk 005551,first,2
mediator_1,let him go for a minute and then you can go,first,2
Donald Trump,and rebuild the building,first,2
Joe Biden,no,first,1
Donald Trump,it’s the dumbest,first,0
Joe Biden,that is not,first,2
Donald Trump,… most ridiculous crosstalk 005556 where two car systems are out,first,1
Joe Biden,not true,first,2
Donald Trump,… where they want to take out the cows too,first,2
Joe Biden,not true,first,2
Donald Trump,that’s not true either right,first,2
Joe Biden,not true,first,2
Donald Trump,this is a 100 trillion,first,2
Joe Biden,simply… look,first,2
Donald Trump,that’s more money than our country could make in 100 years crosstalk 000210,first,3
Joe Biden,that is simply not the case,first,2
mediator_1,all right let me crosstalk 000212 wait a minute sir i actually have studied your plan and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings weatherizing 2 million homes over four years building one and a half million energy efficient homes so the question becomes the president is saying i think some people who support the president would say that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy,first,2
Joe Biden,what it’s going to do it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs good paying jobs crosstalk 000241,first,3
mediator_1,let him finish sir,first,2

mediator_1,all right gentlemen final segment election integrity as we meet tonight millions of americans are receiving mailin ballots or going to vote early how confident should we be that this will be a fair election and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks because it will not only be to election day but also counting some mailin ballots after election day what are you prepared to do to reassure the american people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election in this final segment mr vice president you go first,first,2
Joe Biden,prepare to let people vote they should go to iwillvotecom decide how they’re going to vote when they’re going to vote and what means by which they’re going to vote his own homeland security director and as well as the fbi director says that there is no evidence at all that mailin ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating they said that the fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of covid that are going to be voting by mailin ballots like he does by the way he sits behind the resolute desk and sends his ballot to florida number one number two we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance the polls are open on time and the polls stay open until the votes are counted and this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate,first,2
Joe Biden,show up and vote you will determine the outcome of this election vote vote vote if you’re able to vote early in your state vote early if you’re able to vote in person vote in person vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will… he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election and in terms of whether or not… when the votes are counted and they’re all counted that will be accepted if i win that will be accepted if i lose that’ll be accepted but by the way if in fact he says he’s not sure what he’s going to accept well let me tell you something it doesn’t matter because if we get the votes it’s going to be all over he’s going to go he can’t stay in power it won’t happen it won’t happen so vote just make sure you understand you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years is it going to change or are you going to get four more years of these lies,first,3
mediator_1,mr president two minutes,first,2
Donald Trump,so when i listen to joe talking about a transition there has been no transition from when i won i won that election and if you look at crooked hillary clinton if you look at all of the different people there was no transition because they came after me trying to do a coup they came after me spying on my campaign they started from the day i won and even before i won from the day i came down the escalator with our first lady they were a disaster they were a disgrace to our country and we’ve caught them we’ve caught them all we’ve got it all on tape we’ve caught them all and by the way you gave the idea for the logan act against general flynn you better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense and president obama was sitting in the office,first,2
Donald Trump,he knew about it too so don’t tell me about a free transition as far as the ballots are concerned it’s a disaster a solicited ballot okay solicited is okay you’re soliciting you’re asking they send it back you send it back i did that if you have an unsolicited… they’re sending millions of ballots all over the country there’s fraud they found them in creeks they found some just happened to have the name trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket they’re being sent all over the place they sent two in a democrat area they sent out a thousand ballots everybody got two ballots this is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen the other thing it’s nice on november 3rd you’re watching and you see who won the election and i think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done,first,0
Donald Trump,but you know what we won’t know we might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over take a look at what happened in manhattan take a look at what happened in new jersey take a look at what happened in virginia and other places they’re not losing 2 1 which by the way is too much an election could be won or lost with that they’re losing 30 and 40 it’s a fraud and it’s a shame and can you imagine where they say “you have to have your ballot in by november 10th” november 10th that’s seven days after the election in theory should have been announced we have major states crosstalk 010358 with that,first,2
mediator_1,sir,first,2
Donald Trump,… all run by democrats,first,2
mediator_1,two minutes is two minutes,first,2
Donald Trump,all run by democrats,first,2
mediator_1,president trump,first,2
Donald Trump,it’s a rigged election,first,1
mediator_1,you’re going to be able to continue you have been charging for months that mailin balloting is going to be a disaster you say it’s rigged crosstalk 00010411 that it’s going to lead to fraud but in 2018 in the last midterm election 31 million people voted mailin voting that was more than a quarter of all the voters that year cast their ballots by mail now that millions of mailin ballots have gone out what are you going to do about it and are you counting on the supreme court including a justice barrett to settle any dispute,first,2
Donald Trump,yeah i think i’m counting on them to look at the ballots definitely i hope we don’t need them in terms of the election itself but for the ballots i think so because what’s happening is incredible i read today where at least 1 of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated they take them we don’t like them we don’t like them they throw them out,first,2
mediator_1,but what are you going to do about it,first,2
Donald Trump,… left and right,first,2
mediator_1,there are millions of ballots going out right now what are you going to do,first,2
Donald Trump,what you do is you go and vote you do a solicited ballot and that’s okay,first,2
mediator_1,no no i know your complaint crosstalk 010505 i’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received,first,2
Donald Trump,you go and vote you go and vote,first,3
mediator_1,no but what i’m saying is crosstalk 010511 what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people,first,2
Donald Trump,you either do chris a solicited ballot where you’re sending it in they’re sending it back and you’re sending they have mailmen with lots of it did you see what’s going on take a look at west virginia mailman selling the ballots they’re being sold they’re being dumped in rivers this is a horrible thing for our country,first,2
Joe Biden,there is no crosstalk 010532… there is no evidence of that,first,1
Donald Trump,this is not going to end well,first,1
Joe Biden,there is no evidence of that,first,2
Donald Trump,this is not going to end well,first,1
mediator_1,okay vice president biden in fact go ahead sir,first,2
Joe Biden,five states have had mailin ballots for the last decade or more five including two republican states and you don’t have to solicit the ballot it’s sent to you it’s sent to your home what they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day if it doesn’t get in until the seventh eighth ninth it still should be counted he’s just afraid of counting the votes,first,2
Donald Trump,you’re wrong you’re wrong crosstalk 010604 i love counting the votes crosstalk 010605,first,2
mediator_1,i want to continue with you on this crosstalk 010606 vice president biden,first,3
Donald Trump,chris he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that,first,1
mediator_1,no excuse me vice president biden the biggest problem in fact over the years with mailin voting has not been fraud historically it has been that sizable numbers sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out or there is some other irregularity or they missed crosstalk 010628 the deadline so the question i have is are you concerned that the supreme court with a justice barrett will settle any dispute,first,1
Joe Biden,i am concerned that any court would settle this because here’s the deal when you get a ballot and you fill it out you’re supposed to have an affidavit if you didn’t know you have someone say that this is me you should be able to if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct i who they voted for testify say who they voted for say it’s you that is totally legitimate,first,1
mediator_1,all right,first,2
Donald Trump,excuse me crosstalk 010711,first,2
mediator_1,no no no i have a final crosstalk 001312 gentlemen i have a final question crosstalk 010714,first,2
Donald Trump,you know it can’t be done you know it can’t and already there’s been fraud crosstalk 010719,first,1
Joe Biden,mail service delivers crosstalk 010721 185 million pieces of mail a day crosstalk 010724,first,2
mediator_1,we can keep talking in eight states crosstalk 010727 election workers are prohibited currently by law eight states from even beginning to process ballots even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day that means that it’s likely because there’s going to be a huge increase in mailin balloting that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is that it could be days it could be weeks,first,2
Donald Trump,could be months,first,2
mediator_1,… until we find out who the new president is first for you sir finally for the vice president and i hope neither of you will interrupt the other will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period not to engage in any civil unrest and will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified president trump you go first,first,2
Donald Trump,i’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully because that’s what has to happen i am urging them to do it as you know today there was a big problem in philadelphia they went in to watch they’re called poll watchers a very safe very nice thing they were thrown out they weren’t allowed to watch you know why because bad things happen in philadelphia bad things and i am urging my people i hope it’s going to be a fair election if it’s a fair election,first,3
mediator_1,you’re urging them what,first,2
Donald Trump,… i am 100 on board but if i see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated i can’t go along with that and i’ll tell you why,first,1
mediator_1,what does that mean not go along,first,2
Donald Trump,… from a common sense,first,2
mediator_1,does that mean you’re going to tell your people,first,2
Donald Trump,i’ll tell you what it means,first,2
mediator_1,… to take to the streets,first,2
Donald Trump,it means you have a fraudulent election you’re sending out 80 million ballots,first,1
mediator_1,and what would you do about that,first,2
Donald Trump,they’re not equipped… these people aren’t equipped to handle it number one number two they cheat they cheat hey they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago and they all had the name military ballots there were military they all had the name trump on them,first,1
mediator_1,vice president biden,first,2
Donald Trump,you think that’s good,first,2
mediator_1,vice president biden final question for you will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted and will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified,first,2
Joe Biden,yes and here’s the deal we count the ballots as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day and if there’s thousands of ballots it’s going to take time to do it and by the way our military… they’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the civil war in effect and that’s what’s going to happen why is it for them somehow not fraudulent it’s the same process it’s honest no one has established at all that there is fraud related to mailin ballots that somehow it’s a fraudulent process,first,2
Donald Trump,it’s already been established take a look at carolyn maloney’s race,first,2
mediator_1,i asked you you had an opportunity to respond crosstalk 011013 go ahead crosstalk 011014 vice president biden go ahead,first,2
Joe Biden,he has no idea what he’s talking about here’s the deal the fact is i will accept it and he will too you know why because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted all the votes are counted that’ll be the end of it that’ll be the end of it and if it’s me in fact fine if it’s not me i’ll support the outcome and i’ll be a president not just for the democrats i’ll be a president for democrats and republicans and this guy,first,1
Donald Trump,i want to see an honest ballot cut,first,2
mediator_1,gentlemen just say that’s the end of it crosstalk 011045 this is the end of this debate,first,2
Donald Trump,i want to see an honest ballot count,first,2
mediator_1,we’re going to leave it there,first,2
Donald Trump,and i think he does too,first,2

mediator_2,and i do want to say a very good evening to both of you this debate will cover six major topics at the beginning of each section each candidate will have two minutes uninterrupted to answer my first question the debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired after that both microphones will remain on but on behalf of the voters i’m going to ask you to please speak one at a time,second,3
mediator_2,the goal is for you to hear each other and for the american people to hear every word of what you both have to say and so with that if you’re ready let’s start and we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus president trump the first question is for you the country is heading into a dangerous new phase more than 40000 americans are in the hospital tonight with covid including record numbers here in tennessee and since the two of you last shared a stage 16000 americans have died from covid so please be specific how would you lead the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis two minutes uninterrupted,second,2
mediator_2,… during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis two minutes uninterrupted,second,2
Donald Trump,so as you know 22 million people modeled out were expected to die we closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from china it’s a worldwide pandemic it’s all over the world you see the spikes in europe and many other places right now if you notice the mortality rate is down 85 the excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country and we’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard there is a spike there was a spike in florida and it’s now gone,second,2
Donald Trump,there was a very big spike in texas it’s now gone there was a very big spike in arizona it’s now gone and there was some spikes and surges and other places they will soon be gone we have a vaccine that’s coming it’s ready it’s going to be announced within weeks and it’s going to be delivered we have operation warp speed which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine,second,2
Donald Trump,i can tell you from personal experience i was in the hospital i had it and i got better and i will tell you that i had something that they gave me a therapeutic i guess they would call it some people could say it was a cure but i was in for a short period of time and i got better very fast or i wouldn’t be here tonight and now they say i’m immune whether it’s four months or a lifetime nobody’s been able to say that but i’m immune more and more people are getting better we have a problem that’s a worldwide problem this is a worldwide problem but i’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do if you take a look at what we’ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else and in particular ventilators we’re now making ventilators all over the world thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world it will go away and as i say we’re rounding the turn we’re rounding the corner it’s going away,second,3
mediator_2,okay former vice president biden to you how would you lead the country out of this crisis you have two minutes uninterrupted,second,2
Joe Biden,220000 americans dead you hear nothing else i say tonight hear this anyone who is responsible for not taking control in fact not saying i take no responsibility initially anyone is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the united states of america we’re in a situation where there are a thousand deaths a day now a thousand deaths a day and there are over 70000 new cases per day compared to what’s going on in europe as the new england medical journal said they’re starting from a very low rate we’re starting from a very high rate,second,1
Joe Biden,the expectation is we’ll have another 200000 americans dead between now and the end of the year if we just wore these masks the president’s own advisors have told him we can save a 100000 lives and we’re in a circumstance where the president thus far and still has no plan no comprehensive plan,second,1
Joe Biden,what i would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time i would make sure we move into the direction of rapid testing investing in rapid testing i would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe and give them the wherewithal the financial resources to be able to do that,second,2
Joe Biden,we’re in a situation now where the new england medical journal one of the serious most serious journals in the whole world said for the first time ever that the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic and so folks i will take care of this i will end this i will make sure we have a plan,second,2
mediator_2,president trump i’d like to follow up with you and your comments you talked about taking a therapeutic i assume you’re referencing regeneron you also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks is that a guarantee,second,2
Donald Trump,no it’s not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year but i think it has a good chance there are two companies i think within a matter of weeks and it will be distributed very quickly,second,3
mediator_2,can you tell us which companies,second,2
Donald Trump,johnson johnson is doing very well moderna is doing very well pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others then we also have others that we’re working on very closely with other countries in particular europe,second,3
mediator_2,let me follow up with you and because this is new information you have set a vaccine is coming soon within weeks now your own officials say “it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough americans to get vaccinated” and even then they say “the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022” is your timeline realistic,second,2
Donald Trump,no i think my timeline is going to be more accurate i don’t know that they’re counting on the military the way i do but we have our generals lined up one in particular that’s the head of logistics and this is a very easy distribution for him he’s ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have a 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine he’s ready to go,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden your reaction and just 40 of americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government what steps would you take to give americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved,second,2
Joe Biden,make sure it’s totally transparent have the scientists of the world see it know it look at it go through all the processes and by the way this is the same fellow who told you “this is going to end by easter” last time this is the same fellow who told you that “don’t worry we’re going to end this by the summer” we’re about to go into a dark winter a dark winter and he has no clear plan and there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the american people before the middle of next year,second,2
mediator_2,president trump your reaction he says you have no plan,second,2
Donald Trump,i don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all we’re opening up our country we’ve learned and studied and understand the disease which we didn’t at the beginning when i closed and banned china from coming in heavily infected and then ultimately europe but china was in january months later he was saying i was xenophobic i did it too soon now he’s saying “oh i should have moved quicker” but he didn’t move quicker he was months behind me many months behind me,second,2
Donald Trump,and frankly he ran the h1n1 swine flu and it was a total disaster far less lethal but it was a total disaster had that had this kind of numbers 700000 people would be dead right now but it was a far less lethal disease look his own person who ran that for him who as you know was his chief of staff said “it was catastrophic it was horrible we didn’t know what we were doing” now he comes up and he tells us how to do this,second,1
Donald Trump,also everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make that’s what we’ve done we’ve done all of it but he was way behind us,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden your response,second,2
Joe Biden,my response is he is xenophobic but not because he shutdown access from china and he did it late after 40 countries had already done that in addition to that what he did he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there in china trying to get the wuhan to determine what exactly the source was what did the president say in january he said ” no” he said “he’s being transparent the president of china is being transparent we owe him a debt of gratitude we have to thank him”,second,1
Joe Biden,and then what happened was we started talking about using the defense act to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people and again i go back to this he had nothing he did virtually nothing and then he gets out of the hospital and he talks about “oh don’t worry it’s all going to be over soon” come on there’s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon,second,1
mediator_2,president trump your reaction,second,2
Joe Biden,i didn’t say over soon i say we’re learning to live with it we have no choice we can’t lock ourselves up in a basement like joe does he has the ability to lock himself up i don’t know he’s obviously made a lot of money someplace but he has this thing about living in a basement people can’t do that by the way i as the president couldn’t do that i’d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the white house and go away for a year and a half until it disappears i can’t do that,second,2
Joe Biden,and kirsten every meeting i had every meeting i had and i’d meet a lot of families including gold star families and military families every meeting i had and i had to meet them i had to it would be horrible to have canceled everything i said “this is dangerous and you catch it” and i caught it i learned a lot i learned a lot great doctors great hospitals and now i recovered 999 of young people recover 99 of people recover we have to recover,second,2
Donald Trump,99 of people recover we have to recover we can’t close up our nation we have to open our school and we can’t close up our nation or you’re not going to have a nation,second,2
mediator_2,and of course the cdc has said young people can get sick with covid19 and can pass it vice president biden i want to talk broadly about strategy though,second,2
Joe Biden,can i respond to that,second,2
mediator_2,30 seconds please then i have a question,second,2
Joe Biden,number one he says that we’re learning to live with it people are learning to die with it you folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning that man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch there out of habit where their wife or husband was is gone learning to live with it come on we’re dying with it because he’s never said see you said “it’s dangerous” when’s the last time is it really dangerous still are we dangerous you tell the people it’s dangerous now what should they do about the danger and you say “i take no responsibility”,second,2
mediator_2,let me talk about your tuesday,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me i take full responsibility it’s not my fault that it came here it’s china’s fault and you know what it’s not joe’s fault that it came here either it’s china’s fault they kept it from going into the rest of china for the most part but they didn’t keep it from coming out to the world including europe and ourselves,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden,second,2
Joe Biden,the fact is that when we knew it was coming when it hit what happened what did the president say he said “don’t worry it’s going to go away it’ll be gone by easter don’t worry warm weather don’t worry maybe inject bleach” he said he was kidding when he said that but a lot of people thought it was serious a whole range of things the president has said even today he thinks we are in control we’re about to lose 200000 more people,second,2
mediator_2,president trump,second,2
Donald Trump,look perhaps just to finish this i was kidding on that but just to finish this when i closed he said i shouldn’t have closed and that went on for months nancy pelosi said the same thing she was dancing on the streets in chinatown in san francisco but when i closed he said “this is a terrible thing you xenophobic” i think he called me racist even because i was closing it to china now he says i should have closed it earlier joe it doesn’t,second,1
Joe Biden,i didn’t say either of those things,second,2
Donald Trump,you certainly did you certainly did,second,2
Joe Biden,i talked about his xenophobia in a different context it wasn’t about closing the border to chinese coming to the united states,second,2
mediator_2,all right i want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this,second,2
Donald Trump,he thought i shouldn’t have closed the border that’s obvious,second,2
mediator_2,do you want to respond to that quickly vice president biden,second,2
Joe Biden,no,second,1
mediator_2,okay let’s talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this mr vice president you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it what do you say to americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns the impact on the economy the higher rates of hunger depression domestic and substance abuse outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus,second,2
Joe Biden,what i would say is i’m going to shut down the virus not the country it’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part why businesses have gone under why schools are closed why so many people have lost their living and why they’re concerned those other concerns are real that’s why he should have been instead of in a sand trap at his golf course he should have been negotiating with nancy pelosi and the rest of the democrats and republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity,second,1
mediator_2,but you haven’t ruled out more shut downs,second,2
Joe Biden,oh well no i’m not shutting down today but there are … look you need standards the standard is if you have a reproduction rate in a community that’s above a certain level everybody says “slow up more social distancing do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums do not open until you get this under control under more control” but when you do open give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely for example schools schools they need a lot of money to be open they need to deal with ventilation systems they need to deal with smaller classes more teachers more pods and he’s refused to support that money or at least up to now,second,2
mediator_2,let’s talk about schools president trump,second,2
Donald Trump,i think we have to respond if i might,second,2
mediator_2,please and then i have a followup,second,2
Donald Trump,thank you and i appreciate that look all he does is talk about shut downs but forget about him his democrat governors cuomo in new york you look at what’s going on in california you look at pennsylvania north carolina democrats democrats all they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying they’re dying and he supports all these people all he talks about is shut downs no we’re not going to shut down and we have to open our schools and it’s like as an example i have a young son he also tested positive by the time i spoke to the doctor the second time he was fine it just went away young people i guess it’s their immune system,second,2
mediator_2,let me follow up with you president trump you’ve demanded schools open in person and insist they can do it safely but just yesterday boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike what is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids but also their teachers and family,second,2
Donald Trump,i want to open the schools the transmittal rate to the teachers is very small but i want to open the schools we have to open our country we’re not going to have a country you can’t do this we can’t keep this country closed this is a massive country with a massive economy people are losing their jobs they’re committing suicide there’s depression alcohol drugs at a level that nobody’s ever seen before there’s abuse tremendous abuse we have to open our country i’ve said it often the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself and that’s what’s happening and he wants to close down he’ll close down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden your response,second,2
Joe Biden,simply not true we ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time we ought to be able to safely open but they need resources to open you need to be able to for example if you’re going to open a business have social distancing within the business you need to have if you have a restaurant you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another you need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether the person is in fact infected you need to be able to trace you need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we’re going to make sure that we’re going to open safely and by the way all you teachers out there not that many of you are going to die so don’t worry about it so don’t worry about it come on,second,2
mediator_2,president trump let me follow up with you quickly,second,2
Donald Trump,by the way i will say this if you go and look at what’s happened to new york it’s a ghost town it’s a ghost town and when you talk about plexiglass these are restaurants that had dying these are businesses with no money putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive and it’s not the answer i mean you’re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic these are businesses that are dying joe you can’t do that to people you just can’t take a look at new york and what’s happened to my wonderful city for so many years i loved it it was vibrant it’s dying everyone’s leaving new york,second,1
mediator_2,vice president biden,second,2
Joe Biden,take a look at what new york has done in terms of turning the curve down in terms of the number of people dying and i don’t look at this in terms of the way he does blue states and red states they’re all the united states and look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus they’re the red states they’re the states in the midwest they’re the states in the upper midwest that’s where the spike is occurring significantly but they’re all americans they’re all americans and what we have to do is say wear these masks number one make sure we get the help that the businesses need that money’s already been passed to do that it’s been out there since the beginning of the summer and nothing’s happened,second,2
Donald Trump,kristen new york has lost more than 40000 people 11000 people in nursing homes,second,2
mediator_2,president trump what about,second,2
Donald Trump,when you say spike take a look at what’s happening in pennsylvania where they’ve had it closed take a look at what’s happening with your friend in michigan where her husband’s the only one allowed to do anything it’s been like a prison now it was just ruled unconstitutional take a look at north carolina they’re having spikes and they’ve been closed and they’re getting killed financially we can’t let that happen joe you can’t let that happen we have to open up and we understand the disease we have to protect our seniors we have to protect our elderly we have to protect especially our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems and we will protect we have the best testing in the world by far that’s why we have so many cases,second,2
mediator_2,let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section president trump this week you called dr anthony fauci the nation’s best known infectious disease expert “a disaster” you described him and other medical experts as “idiots” if you’re not listening to them who are you listening to,second,1
Donald Trump,i’m listening to all of them including anthony i get along very well with anthony,second,3
Donald Trump,… think to all of them including anthony i get along very well with anthony but he did say “don’t wear masks” he did say as you know “this is not going to be a problem” i think he’s a democrat but that’s okay he said “this is not going to be a problem we are not going to have a problem at all” when joe says that i said anthony fauci said and others and many others and i’m not knocking him nobody knew look nobody knew what this thing was nobody knew where it was coming from what it was we’ve learned a lot but anthony said “don’t wear masks” now he wants to wear masks anthony also said if you look back exact words here’s his exact words “this is no problem this is going to go away soon” so he’s allowed to make mistakes he happens to be a good person,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden your response quickly and then we’re going to move on to the next section,second,2
Joe Biden,my response is that think about what the president knew in january and didn’t tell the american people he was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air and it was much worse much worse than the flu he went on record and said to one of your colleagues recorded that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn’t want to tell us he didn’t want to tell us because he didn’t want us to panic he didn’t want us… americans don’t panic he panicked but guess what in the meantime we find out in the new york times the other day that in fact his folks went to wall street and said “this is a really dangerous thing” and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration but from some of the brokers — said “sell short because we’ve got to get moving it’s a dangerous problem”,second,2
Donald Trump,well this is what i,second,2
mediator_2,i’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we’re going to move on,second,2
Donald Trump,crosstalk 002834 i don’t know somebody went through wall street you’re the one that takes all the money from wall street i don’t take it,second,1
Joe Biden,i haven’t,second,2
Donald Trump,joe you have raised a lot of money tremendous amounts of money and every time you raise money deals are made joe i could raise so much more money as president and as somebody that knows most of those people i could call the heads of wall street the heads of every company in america i would blow away every record but i don’t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position and then you bring up wall street you shouldn’t be bringing up wall street because you’re the one that takes the money from wall street not me i could blow away your records like you wouldn’t believe we don’t need money we have plenty of money in fact we beat hillary clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to crosstalk 002915,second,3
mediator_2,all right gentlemen we’re going to move on,second,2
Donald Trump,don’t tell me about crosstalk 002917,second,2
Joe Biden,average contribution 43,second,2
mediator_2,all right we’re going to move on to our next section which is national security and i do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight just last night top intelligence officials confirmed again that both russia and iran are working to influence this election both countries have obtained us voter registration information these officials say and iran sent intimidating messages to florida voters this question goes to you mr vice president what would you do to put an end to this threat you have two minutes uninterrupted,second,2
Joe Biden,i made it clear and i asked everyone else to take the pledge i made it clear that any country no matter who it is that interferes in american elections will pay a price they will pay a price and it’s been overwhelmingly clear this election — i won’t even get into the last one — this election that russia has been involved china’s been involved to some degree and now we learn that iran is involved they will pay a price if i’m elected they’re interfering with american sovereignty that’s what’s going on right now they’re interfering with american sovereignty,second,2
Joe Biden,and to the best of my knowledge i don’t think the president has said anything to putin about it i don’t think he’s talking to them a lot i don’t think he’s said a word i don’t know why he hasn’t said a word to putin about it and i don’t know what he has recently said if anything to the iranians my guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the iranians,second,2
Joe Biden,but the point is this folks we are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election his own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy… well i shouldn’t… well i will his buddy rudy giuliani he’s being used as a russian pawn he’s being fed information that is russian that is not true and then what happens nothing happens and then you find out that everything that’s going on here about russia is wanting to make sure that i do not get elected the next president of the united states because they know i know them and they know me,second,2
Joe Biden,i don’t understand why this president is unwilling to take on putin when he’s actually paying bounties to kill american soldiers in afghanistan when he’s engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of nato i don’t know why he doesn’t do it but it’s worth asking the question why isn’t that being done any country that interferes with us will in fact pay a price because they’re affecting our sovereignty,second,1
mediator_2,president trump same question to you crosstalk 003148 let me ask the question you’re going to have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries what would you do in your next term to put an end to this two minutes uninterrupted,second,2
Donald Trump,well let me respond to the first part as joe answered joe got 35 million from russia and it came through putin because he was very friendly with the former mayor of moscow and it was the mayor of moscow’s wife and you got 35 million your family got 35 million and someday you’re going to have to explain why did you get three and a half i never got any money from russia i don’t get money from russia,second,2
Donald Trump,now about your thing last night i knew all about that and through john — who is john ratcliffe who is fantastic dni — he said the one thing that’s common to both of them,second,3
Donald Trump,they both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to russia between the sanctions nobody tougher than me on russia between the sanctions between all of what i’ve done with nato i’ve got the nato countries to put up an extra 130 billion going to 420 billion a year that’s to guard against russia i sold while he was selling pillows and sheets i sold tank busters to ukraine there has been nobody tougher on russia than donald trump,second,2
Donald Trump,and i’ll tell you they were so bad they took over the submarine port you remember that very well during your term during you and barack obama they took over a big part of what should have been ukraine you handed it to them but you were getting a lot of money from russia they were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are but now with what came out today it’s even worse all of the emails the emails the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in you and your family and joe you were vicepresident when some of this was happening and it should have never happened and i think you owe an explanation to the american people why is it somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family but what he said was damning and regardless of me i think you have to clean it up and talk to the american people maybe you can do it right now,second,1
mediator_2,vicepresident biden you may respond,second,2
Joe Biden,crosstalk 000131,second,2
mediator_2,… and then i do want to follow up on the election security,second,2
Joe Biden,i have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life we learned that this president paid 50 times the tax in china as a secret bank account with china does business in china and in fact is talking about me taking money i have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever ever number one,second,2
Joe Biden,number two this is a president… i have released all of my tax returns 22 years go look at them 22 years of my tax return you have not released a single solitary year of your tax return what are you hiding why are you unwilling the foreign countries are paying you a lot russia’s paying you a lot china’s paying you a lot on your hotels and all your businesses all around the country all around the world and china’s building a new road to a new golf course you have overseas so what’s going on here release your tax return or stop talking about corruption,second,2
mediator_2,president trump your response,second,2
Donald Trump,first of all i called my accountants underwrote it i’m going to release them as soon as we can i want to do it and it’ll show how successful how great this company is but much more importantly than that people were saying 750 i asked them a week ago i said “what did i pay” they said “sir you prepaid tens of millions of dollars” i prepaid my tax over the last number of years tens of millions of dollars i prepaid because at some point they think it’s an estimate they think i may have to pay tax so i already prepaid it nobody told me that nobody told you that,second,4
mediator_2,did your accountant tell you crosstalk 000311,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me and it wasn’t written whenever they write this they keep talking about 750 which i think is a filing fee but let me just tell you i prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes number one,second,1
Donald Trump,number two i don’t make money from china you do i don’t make money from ukraine you do i don’t make money from russia you made 35 million joe and your son gave you they even have a statement that we have to give 10 to the big man you’re the big man i think i don’t know maybe you’re not but you’re the big man i think your son said we have to give 10 to the big men joe what’s that all about it’s terrible,second,2
mediator_2,all right gentlemen i want to ask you both some questions about all of this but…,second,2
Joe Biden,i have to respond to that,second,2
mediator_2,i’m going to let you both respond very quickly you just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes did he tell you when you can release them do you have a deadline for when you’re going to release them to the american people,second,2
Donald Trump,as soon as the auditors finish i get treated worse than the tea party got treated because i have a lot of people in there,second,0
mediator_2,crosstalk 000406,second,2
Donald Trump,… deep down in the irs they treat me horribly we made a deal it was all settled until i decide to run for president i get treated very badly by the irs very unfairly but we had a deal all done as soon as we’re completed with the deal i want to release it but i have paid millions and millions of dollars and it’s worse than paying i paid in advance it’s called prepaying your taxes i paid crosstalk 000432,second,1
mediator_2,okay i want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly respond very quickly and then i’ll get to my question,second,2
Joe Biden,why did he… he’s been saying this for four years show us just show us stop playing around you’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes,second,1
Donald Trump,everybody knows,second,2
Joe Biden,nobody knows mr president what they do know is you’re not paying your taxes or you’re paying taxes that are so low when last time he said what he paid he said i only pay that little because i’m smart i know how to game the system come on come on folks,second,1
Donald Trump,so…,second,2
mediator_2,crosstalk 000511 president trump and then i want to get to two questions to both of you on this,second,2
Joe Biden,sure,second,2
Donald Trump,i was put through a phony witch hunt for three years it started before i even got elected they spied of my campaign no president should ever have to go through what i went through let me just say this mueller and 18 angry democrats and fbi agents all over the place spent 48 million they went through everything i had including my tax returns and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong 48 million i guarantee you if i spent 1 million on you joe i could find plenty wrong because the kind of things,second,0
mediator_2,all right,second,2
Donald Trump,… that you’ve done and the kind of monies that your family has taken i mean your brother made money in iraq,second,2
mediator_2,let me…,second,2
Donald Trump,… millions of dollars your other brother made a fortune and it’s all through you joe and they say you get some of it and you do live very well you have houses all over the place you live very well,second,3
mediator_2,all right gentlemen let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly vicepresident biden there have been questions about the work your son has done in china and for a ukrainian energy company when you were vicepresident in retrospect was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical,second,2
Joe Biden,nothing was unethical here’s what the deal with regard to ukraine we had this whole question about whether or not because he was on the board i later learned of burisma a company that somehow i had done something wrong yet every single solitary person when he was going through his impeachment testifying under oath who work for him said i did my job impeccably i carried out us policy not one single solitary thing was out of line not a single thing number one,second,2
Joe Biden,number two the guy who got in trouble in ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the ukrainian government to say something negative about me which they would not do and did not do because it never ever ever happened my son has not made money in terms of this thing about what are you talking about china i have not had… the only guy who made money from china is this guy he’s the only one nobody else has made money from china,second,1
mediator_2,president trump,second,2
Donald Trump,crosstalk 000725…,second,2
mediator_2,… let me ask my question to you crosstalk 000728…,second,2
Donald Trump,but could i just one thing,second,2
mediator_2,very quickly,second,2
Donald Trump,his son didn’t have a job for a long time was sadly no longer in the military service i won’t get into that and he didn’t have a job as soon as he became vicepresident burisma not the best reputation in the world i hear they paid him 183000 a month listen to this 183000 and they gave him a 3 million upfront payment and he had no energy experience that’s 100 dishonest,second,1
mediator_2,all right i’m going to let the vicepresident respond to that quickly and then i need to get to a question to you very quickly mr vicepresident,second,2
Joe Biden,no basis for that everybody investigated that no one said anything he did was wrong in ukraine,second,1
mediator_2,okay president trump this is for you since you took office you’ve never divested from your business you’ve personally promoted your properties abroad a report this week which was referenced does indicate that your company has a bank account in china so how can voters know that you don’t have any foreign conflicts of interest,second,2
Donald Trump,i have many bank accounts and they’re all listed and they’re all over the place i mean i was a businessman doing business the bank account you’re referring to which is everybody knows about it it’s listed the bank account was in 2013 that’s what it was it was opened it was closed in 2015 i believe and then i decided because i was going to do… i was thinking about doing a deal in china like millions of other people i was thinking about it and i decided i’m not going to do it didn’t like it i decided not to do it had an account open and i closed it,second,2
mediator_2,okay,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me and then unlike him where he’s vicepresident and he does business i then decided to run for president after that that was before so i closed it before i even ran for president let alone became president big difference he is the vicepresident of the united states and his son his brother and his other brother are getting rich they’re like a vacuum cleaner they’re sucking up money crosstalk 000920,second,2
mediator_2,okay president trump thank you we do need to move on,second,2
Joe Biden,not true,second,2
mediator_2,i do want to ask you vicepresident biden about china let’s talk about china more broadly there have of course president trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus if you were president would you make china pay and please be specific what would that look like,second,2
Joe Biden,what i’d make china do is play by the international rules not like he has done he has caused the deficit of the china to go up not down with china up not down we are making sure that in order to do business in china you have to give all your intellectual property you have to have a partner in china it’s 51 we would not do that at all number one,second,2
Joe Biden,number two we’re in a situation where china would have to play by the rules internationally as well when i met with xi and when i was still vicepresident he said we’re setting up air identification zones in the south china sea you can’t fly through them i said we’re going to fly through them we just flew b52 b1 bombers through it we’re not going to pay attention they have to play by the rules and what’s he do he embraces guys like the thugs like in north korea and the chinese president and putin and others and he pokes his finger inaudible 001036 all of our friends all of our allies we make up only… we’re 25 25 of the world’s economy we need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to china “these are the rules you play by them or you’re going to pay the price for not paying by them economically”,second,2
Joe Biden,that’s the way i will run it and that’s what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vicepresident,second,2
mediator_2,all right let’s talk about north korea,second,2
Donald Trump,no no no,second,1
mediator_2,let…,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me no i have to…,second,2
Joe Biden,… and vice president,second,2
mediator_2,all right let’s talk about north korea,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me no i have to respond to that,second,2
mediator_2,okay very quickly and then we’re going to move on to north korea,second,2
Donald Trump,his son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from china to …,second,2
Joe Biden,not true,second,2
Donald Trump,… after spending 10 minutes in office and being in air force two number one number two there’s a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make 10 million a year for introductions,second,2
mediator_2,president trump on china policy,second,2
Joe Biden,that’s not true,second,2
mediator_2,… though what specifically,second,2
Donald Trump,no but wait a minute,second,2
mediator_2,what are you going to do what specifically are you going to do to make china pay you’ve said you’re going to make them pay,second,2
Donald Trump,first of all china is paying they’re paying billions and billions of dollars i just gave 28 billion,second,2
mediator_2,new sanctions,second,2
Donald Trump,i just gave 28 billion to our farmers,second,2
Joe Biden,tax payer’s money,second,2
Donald Trump,it’s what,second,2
Joe Biden,taxpayer’s money didn’t come from china,second,2
Donald Trump,no no you know who the taxpayer is it’s called china,second,2
Joe Biden,not true,second,2
Donald Trump,china pays 28 billion and you know what they did to pay it joe they devalued their currency and they also paid up and you know got the money our farmers our great farmers because they were targeted you never charged them anything also i charged them 25 on dumped steel because they were killing our steel industry we were not going to have a steel industry,second,2
mediator_2,okay,second,2
Donald Trump,and now we have a steel industry,second,2
mediator_2,okay vice president biden your response please,second,2
Joe Biden,my response is look there’s a reason why he’s bringing up all this malarkey there’s a reason for it he doesn’t want to talk about the substantive issues it’s not about his family and my family it’s about your family and your family’s hurting badly if you’re a middleclass family you’re getting hurt badly right now you’re sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding “well we can’t get new tires they’re bald because we have to wait another month or so” or “are we going to be able to pay the mortgage” or “who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to community college” they’re the decisions you’re making and the middleclass families like i grew up in scranton and claymont they’re in trouble we should be talking about your families but that’s the last thing he wants to talk about,second,1
Donald Trump,that is a typical statement,second,2
Joe Biden,i want to talk about north korea,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me just for one second please,second,2
mediator_2,10 seconds mr president 10 seconds,second,2
Donald Trump,that’s a typical political statement let’s get off this china thing and then he looks “the family around the table everything” just a typical politician when i see that i’m not a typical politician,second,2
mediator_2,let’s talk about north korea now,second,2
Donald Trump,that’s why i got elected let’s get off the subject of china let’s talk about sitting around the table come on joe you could do better,second,1
mediator_2,we’re going to talk about north korea now president trump you’ve met with north korean leader kim jongun three times you’ve talked about your beautiful letters with him you’ve touted the fact that there hasn’t been a war or a long range missile test and yet north korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship you forged,second,2
Donald Trump,no,second,1
mediator_2,just 30 seconds here because we need to get onto the next topic,second,1
Donald Trump,so when i met with barack obama we sat in the white house right at the beginning had a great conversation was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour he said “the biggest problem we have is north korea” he indicated we will be in a war with north korea guess what it would be a nuclear war and he does have plenty of nuclear capability in the meantime i have a very good relationship with him different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me we have a different kind of a relationship we have a very good relationship and there’s no war and about two months ago he broke into a certain area they said “oh there’s going to be trouble” i said “no they’re not because he’s not going to do that” and i was right look instead of being in a war where millions of people seoul is 25 miles away millions and millions 32 million people millions of people would be dead right now we don’t have a war and i have a good relationship,second,2
mediator_2,president trump that’s 30 seconds vice president biden to you north korea conducted four nuclear tests under the obama administration why do you think you would be able to reign in this persistent threatening,second,2
Joe Biden,because i’d make it clear which we were making clear to china they had to be part of the deal because i made it clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when i went to china that i said “why are you moving your missile defense up so close why are you moving more forces here why are you continue to do military maneuvers with south korea” i said “because north korea is a problem and we’re going to continue to do it so we can control them we’re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us and so if you want to do something about it step up and help if not it’s going to continue” what has he done he’s legitimized north korea he’s talked about his good buddy who’s a thug a thug and he talks about how we’re better off and they have much more capable missiles able to reach us territory much more easily than they ever did before,second,2
mediator_2,let me follow up with you vice president biden you’ve said you wouldn’t meet with kim jongun without preconditions are there any conditions under which you would meet with him,second,2
Joe Biden,on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity the korean peninsula should be a nuclear free zone,second,2
mediator_2,all right let’s move on to american families,second,2
Donald Trump,kristen,second,2
mediator_2,very quickly 10 seconds president trump,second,2
Donald Trump,they tried to meet with him he wouldn’t do it he didn’t like obama he didn’t like him he wouldn’t do it,second,1
mediator_2,okay i’ve got to give him a chance to respond to that before we move on,second,2
Donald Trump,i know for a fact they tried we wouldn’t do it and that’s okay you know what north korea we’re not in a war we have a good relationship people don’t understand having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing,second,2
mediator_2,president trump we have to move on because we have a lot of questions to get to your response,second,2
Joe Biden,we had a good relationship with hitler before he in fact invaded europe the rest of europe come on the reason he would not meet with president obama is because president obama said “we’re going to talk about denuclearization we’re not going to legitimize you and we’re going to continue to push stronger and stronger sanctions on you” that’s why he wouldn’t meet with us,second,2
mediator_2,all right let’s move on,second,2
Donald Trump,and it didn’t happen,second,1
mediator_2,let’s move on and talk about american families,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me he left me a mess kristen,second,1
mediator_2,president trump okay,second,2
Donald Trump,they left me a mess north korea was a mess and in fact if you remember the first two or three months it was a very dangerous period in my first three months before we worked things out a little bit,second,2
mediator_2,okay,second,2
Donald Trump,there was a very day they left us a mess and obama would be i think the first to say it was the single biggest problem he thought that our country crosstalk 001703,second,1
mediator_2,okay let’s move on to american families and the economy one of the issues that’s most important to them is healthcare as you both know today there was a key vote on a new supreme court justice amy coney barrett and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight over 20 million americans get their health insurance through the affordable care act it’s headed to the supreme court and your administration mr president is advocating for the court to overturn it if the supreme court does overturn that law there’s 20 million americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight so what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away you have two minutes uninterrupted,second,2
Donald Trump,first of all i’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible through the legislature i terminated the individual mandate that is the worst part of obamacare as we call it the individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance i terminated it’s gone now it’s in court because obamacare is no good but then i made a decision run it as well as you can to my people great people run it as well as you can i could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy they ran it premiums are down everything’s down here’s the problem no matter how well you run it it’s no good what we’d like to do is terminate it we have the individual mandate done i don’t know that it’s going to work if we don’t win we will have to run it and we’ll have obamacare but it’ll be better run but it no longer is obamacare because without the individual mandate it’s much different,second,0
Donald Trump,preexisting conditions will always stay what i would like to do is a much better healthcare much better we’ll always protect people with preexisting so i’d like to terminate obamacare come up with a brand new beautiful healthcare the democrats will do it because there’ll be tremendous pressure on them and we might even have the house by that time and i think we’re going to win the house you’ll see but i think we’re going to win the house but come up with a better healthcare always protecting people with preexisting conditions and one thing very important we have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare far more than we’re talking about with obamacare joe biden is going to terminate all of those policies these are people that love their healthcare people that have been successful middleincome people been successful they have 180 million plans 180 million people families under what he wants to do which will basically be socialized medicine he won’t even have a choice they want to terminate 180 million plans we have done an incredible job at healthcare and we’re going to do even better just you watch,second,1
mediator_2,okay vice president biden yes this is for you your healthcare plan calls for building on obamacare so my question is what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court you have two minutes uninterrupted,second,2
Joe Biden,what i’m going to do is pass obamacare with a public option and become bidencare the public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal if you qualify for medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get medicaid you automatically are enrolled providing competition for insurance companies that’s what’s going to happen secondly we’re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there’s competition that doesn’t exist now by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies thirdly the idea that i want to eliminate private insurance the reason why i had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was i support private insurance that’s why not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan nor did they under obamacare they did not lose their insurance unless they chose they wanted to go to something else,second,2
Joe Biden,lastly we’re going to make sure we’re in a situation that we actually protect preexisting there’s no way he can protect preexisting conditions none zero you can’t do it in the ether he’s been talking about this for a long time he’s never come up with a plan i guess we’re going to get the preexisting condition plan the same time we got the infrastructure plan that we waited for since ’17 ’18 ’19 and 20 i still have a few more minutes i know you’re getting anxious the fact is that he’s already cost the american people because of his terrible handling of the covid virus and economic spillover 10 million people have lost their private insurance and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have it under obamacare and over 110 million people with preexisting conditions and all the people from covid are going to have preexisting conditions what are they going to do,second,2
mediator_2,i have a followup for you vice president biden it relates to something that president trump said he’s accusing you of wanting socialized medicine what do you say to people who have concerns that your healthcare plan which includes a government insurance option takes,second,2
mediator_2,concerns that your healthcare plan which includes a government insurance option takes the country one step closer to a healthcare system run entirely by the government what’s your response to that,second,2
Joe Biden,i say it’s ridiculous it’s like saying that the fact that there’s a public option that people can choose that makes it a socialist plan look the difference between the president and i… i think healthcare is not a privilege it’s a right everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare and i am very proud of my plan it’s gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as a whole range of other people who in fact are concerned in the medical field this is something that’s going to save people’s lives and this is going to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for their children how many of you at home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight wondering what in god’s name you’re going to do if you get sick because you’ve lost your health insurance and your company’s gone under we have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate and that’s what i do,second,2
mediator_2,president trump,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me he was there,second,2
mediator_2,… your response,second,2
Donald Trump,… for 47 years he didn’t do it he was now there as vice president for eight years and it’s not like it was 25 years ago it was three and three quarters… it was just a little while ago right less than four years ago he didn’t do anything he didn’t do it he wants socialized medicine and it’s not that he wants it his vice president she is more liberal than bernie sanders and wants it even more bernie sanders wants it the democrats want it you’re going to have socialized medicine just like you want it with fracking “we’re not going to have fracking we’re going to stop fracking we’re going to stop fracking” then he goes to pennsylvania after he gets a nomination where he got very lucky to get it and he goes to pennsylvania and he says “oh we’re going to have fracking” and you never ask that question and by the way so far i respect very much the way you’re handling this i have to say,second,2
Joe Biden,by the way,second,2
Donald Trump,but somebody should ask the question,second,2
Joe Biden,you can ask it,second,2
Donald Trump,he goes for a year there will be no fracking,second,2
mediator_2,we do have a number,second,2
Donald Trump,there will be no petroleum,second,2
mediator_2,we have a number of topics we’re going to get to,second,3
Donald Trump,no no but that’s a big question,second,2
mediator_2,we’re going to get to a number of topics,second,2
Donald Trump,it’s the same thing with socialized medicine,second,2
Joe Biden,i have to respond to healthcare,second,2
mediator_2,vice president your response please,second,2
Joe Biden,my response is people deserve to have affordable healthcare period period period period and the biden care proposal will in fact provide for that affordable healthcare lower premiums what we’re going to do is going to cost some money it’s going to cost over 750 billion over 10 years to do it and they’re going to have lower premiums you can buy into the better plans the cheaper plans lower your premiums deal with unexpected billing and have your drug prices drop significantly he keeps talking about it he hasn’t done a thing for anybody on healthcare not a thing,second,2
Donald Trump,kristen when he says,second,2
mediator_2,very quickly then i want to talk about what’s happening on capitol hill,second,2
Donald Trump,when he says public option he’s talking about socialized medicine and healthcare when he talks about a public option he’s talking about destroying your medicare totally destroying,second,2
Joe Biden,wrong,second,1
Donald Trump,… and destroying your social security and this whole country will come down bernie sanders tried it in his state,second,2
Joe Biden,bernie,second,2
Donald Trump,he tried it in his state his governor was a very liberal governor they wanted to make it work,second,3
mediator_2,okay let’s hear,second,2
Donald Trump,it was impossible to work,second,1
mediator_2,let’s let vice president biden respond,second,2
Donald Trump,it doesn’t work,second,1
Joe Biden,he’s a very confused guy he thinks he’s running against somebody else he’s running against joe biden i beat all those other people because i disagreed with them joe biden he’s running against and the idea that we’re in a situation that is going to destroy medicare… this is the guy that the actuary of medicare said “if in fact…” that’s social security “if in fact he continues his plan to withhold the tax on social security social security will be bankrupt by 2023 with no way to make up for it” this is the guy who’s tried to cut medicare the idea that donald trump is lecturing me on social security and medicare come on,second,1
Donald Trump,he tried to get rid of,second,2
mediator_2,10 seconds mr president and then i have to go to another question,second,2
Donald Trump,he tried to hurt social security years ago years ago go back and look at the records he tried to hurt social security years ago one thing but this is the guy,second,2
mediator_2,all right let’s move on i’m going to move on,second,2
Donald Trump,… that when they announced last week,second,2
mediator_2,mr president i have to move on to the next question or else we’re not going to have time to talk about it,second,1
Donald Trump,they say the stock market will boom if i’m elected if he’s elected the stock market will crash,second,2
mediator_2,okay let’s move on to the next question,second,2
Donald Trump,the biggest analysts are saying that,second,2
Joe Biden,may i respond,second,2
mediator_2,very quickly,second,2
Joe Biden,look the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what’s happening where i come from in scranton and claymont the people don’t live off of the stock market just in the last three years during this crisis the billionaires in this country made according to wall street 700 billion more dollars 700 billion more dollars because that’s his only measure what happens to the ordinary people out there what happens to them,second,2
mediator_2,let’s talk about what’s happening on capitol hill,second,2
Donald Trump,401ks kristen 401ks are through the roof,second,2
mediator_2,we’re going to move on,second,2
Donald Trump,people’s stock are through the roof,second,3
mediator_2,all right,second,2
Donald Trump,and he doesn’t come from scranton he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it,second,2
mediator_2,okay we’re going to move on to the next question,second,2
Donald Trump,and he left and the people of pennsylvania will show you that,second,2
mediator_2,let me move on to my next question gentlemen,second,2
Donald Trump,they understand,second,2
mediator_2,as of tonight more than 12 million people are out of work and as of tonight 8 million more americans have fallen into poverty and more families are going hungry every day those hit hardest are women and people of color they see washington fighting over a relief bill mr president why haven’t you been able to get them the help they need 30 seconds here,second,2
Donald Trump,because nancy pelosi doesn’t want to approve it i do,second,2
mediator_2,but you’re the president,second,2
Donald Trump,i do but i still have to get unfortunately… that’s one of the reasons i think we’re going to take over the house because of her nancy pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything because she’d love to have some victories on a date called november 3rd nancy pelosi does not want to approve it we are ready willing and able to do something don’t forget we’ve already approved three plans and it’s gone through including the democrats in all fairness this one she doesn’t want it’s near the election because she thinks it helps her politically i think it hurts her politically,second,2
mediator_2,all right mr vice president,second,2
Joe Biden,by the way as you know the republican leader in the united states senate said he can’t pass it he will be able to pass it he does not have republican votes why isn’t he talking to his republican friends,second,2
mediator_2,let me follow up with you vice president biden because,second,2
Donald Trump,if we made a deal the republicans will pass it,second,1
mediator_2,let me ask vice president biden a question you are the leader of the democratic party why have you not pushed the democrats to get a deal for the american people,second,2
Joe Biden,i have and they have pushed it look they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer it’s not new it’s been out there this heroes act has been sitting there and look at what’s happening when i was in charge of the recovery act with 800 billion i was able to get 145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budgets and states that have to balance their budgets and then they have to fire firefighters teachers first responders law enforcement officers so they could keep their cities and counties running he will not support that they have not done a thing for them and mitch mcconnell said “let them go bankrupt let them go bankrupt” come on what’s the matter with these guys,second,2
Donald Trump,the bill that was passed in the house was a bailout of badly run high crime democrat all run by democrat cities and states it was a way of getting a lot of money billions and billions of dollars to these guys it was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people’s pockets to people that come into our country illegally we were going to take care of everything for them and i’d love to do that i’d love to help them but what that does everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country we can’t do it this was a way of taking care of them this was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with covid as per your question but it was really a big bailout for badly run democrat cities and states,second,1
mediator_2,all right i want to,second,2
Joe Biden,by the way if i get elected i’m not going to… i’m running as a proud democrat but i’m going to be an american president i don’t see red states and blue states what i see is american united states and folks every single state out there finds themself in trouble they’re going to start laying off whether they’re red or blue cops firefighters first responders teachers because they have to balance their budget and the founders were smart they allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the united states of america,second,2
mediator_2,i want to talk about the minimum wage gentlemen mr vice president we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners these days do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage you of course support a 15 federal minimum wage,second,2
Joe Biden,i do because i think one of the things we’re going to have to do is we’re going to have to bail them out too we should be bailing them out now those small businesses you got one in six of them going under they’re not going to be able to make it back they passed a package that allows us to be able… they call it ppp money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they can deal with their businesses being open safely schools how they can make classrooms smaller how they can hire more teachers how they can put ventilation systems in they need the help the businesses as well as the schools need the help these guys will not help them it’s not giving them any of the money,second,2
mediator_2,we are going to move on to immigration but i want to get,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me one thing very quickly he said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage that’s not helping i think it should be a state option alabama is different than new york new york is different from vermont every state is different it should be a state option,second,1
mediator_2,you said very recently,second,2
Donald Trump,it’s very important we have to help our small businesses,second,3
mediator_2,you said,second,2
Donald Trump,how are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages what’s going to happen and what’s been proven to happen is when you do that these small businesses fire many of their employees,second,1
mediator_2,you said very recently,second,2
Joe Biden,not true by the way,second,2
mediator_2,… you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour,second,2
Donald Trump,say it say it,second,2
mediator_2,you said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour,second,2
Donald Trump,what i really like and i would consider it to an extent,second,3
mediator_2,in a second administration,second,2
Donald Trump,but what i really like… in a second administration but not to a level that’s going to put all these businesses out of business it should be a state option look i’ve lived,second,3
Joe Biden,every,second,2
Donald Trump,… in different places i know different places they’re all different some places 15 is not so bad in other places other states 15 would be ruinings,second,2
mediator_2,okay president trump thank you quick response vice president biden,second,2
Joe Biden,no one should work one job be below poverty people are making six seven eight bucks an hour these first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they’ve allowed us to make it what’s happening they deserve a minimum wage of 15 anything below that puts you below the poverty level and there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage businesses go out of business that is simply not true,second,2
mediator_2,we’re going to talk about immigration,second,2
Joe Biden,it’s an crosstalk 003235,second,2
mediator_2,we’re going to talk about immigration now gentlemen and we’re going to talk about families within this context mr president your administration separated children from their parents at the border at least 4000 kids you’ve since reversed your zero tolerance policy but the united states can’t locate the parents of more than 500 children so how will these families ever be reunited,second,2
Donald Trump,children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people cartels…,second,2
Donald Trump,inaudible 003300 and lots of bad people cartels and they’re brought here and they used to use them to get into our country we now have as strong a border as we’ve ever had we’re over 400 miles of brand new wall you see the numbers and we let people in but they have to come in legally and they come in through crosstalk 000017,second,2
mediator_2,but how will you reunite these kids with their families mr president,second,2
Donald Trump,but let me just tell you let me just tell you they built cages they used to say i built the cages and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said “look at these cages president trump built them” and then it was determined they were built in 2014 that was him they built cages,second,2
mediator_2,do you have a plan to reunite the kids with their families,second,2
Donald Trump,yes we’re working on it very… we’re trying very hard but a lot of these kids come out without the parents they come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden let me bring you into this conversation quick response and then another question to you,second,2
Joe Biden,these 500plus kids came with parents they separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with “be real tough we’re really strong” and guess what they cannot… coyotes didn’t bring them over their parents were with them they got separated from their parents and it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation,second,2
mediator_2,let me ask you a followup question,second,2
Donald Trump,kristen they did it we changed the policy they did it we changed,second,2
mediator_2,your response to that,second,2
Joe Biden,we did not separate the crosstalk 003425,second,2
Donald Trump,they built the cages who built the cages joe,second,2
Joe Biden,let’s talk about what we’re talking about,second,2
mediator_2,who built the cages joe,second,2
Joe Biden,let’s talk about what we’re talking about what happened parents were ripped… their kids were ripped from their arms and separated and now they cannot find over 500 of the sets of those parents and those kids are alone nowhere to go nowhere to go it’s criminal it’s criminal,second,1
mediator_2,let me ask you about crosstalk 003450 in 10 seconds and then i need to ask crosstalk 003453,second,2
Donald Trump,kristen i will say this they went down we brought reporters everything they are so well taken care of they’re in facilities that were so clean,second,3
mediator_2,but some of them haven’t been reunited with their families,second,2
Donald Trump,they have gotten such good… but just ask one question who built the cages i’d love you to ask him that who built the cages joe,second,2
mediator_2,let me ask about your immigration policy mr vice president the obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform which had been a key promise during the administration it also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course so why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now,second,1
Joe Biden,because we made a mistake made it took too long to get it right took too long to get it right i’ll be president of the united states not vice president of the united states and the fact is i’ve made it very clear within a 100 days i’m going to send to the united states congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people and all of those socalled dreamers those daca kids they’re going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship the idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is they’ve gone to they’ve never seen before i can imagine you’re five years old your parents are taking across the rio grande river and it’s illegal and you say “oh no mom leave me here i’m not going to go with you” they been here many of them are model citizens over 20000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis we owe them we owe them,second,1
mediator_2,president trump your reaction,second,2
Donald Trump,kristen he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do and i’ve changed without having a specific we got rid of catch and release we got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with but he had eight years he was vice president he did nothing except build cages to keep children in,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden your response,second,2
Joe Biden,the catch and release you know what he’s talking about there if in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing they were released and guess what they showed up for a hearing and this is the first president in the history of the united states of america that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country that’s never happened before in america that’s never happened before in america you come to the united states and you make your case that “i seek asylum based on the following premise why i deserve it under american law” they’re sitting in squalor on the other side of the river,second,2
mediator_2,president trump your response 30 seconds and then we’ll move on,second,2
Donald Trump,so important it just shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws catch and release is a disaster a murderer would come in a rapist would come in a very bad person would come in we would take their name we have to release them into our country and then you say they come back less than 1 of the people come back we have to send ice out and border patrol out to find them we would say “come back in two years three years we’re going to give you a court case you did perry mason we’re going to give you a court case” when you say they come back they don’t come back joe they never come back only the really… i hate to say this but those with the lowest iq they might come back but there are very very few,second,1
mediator_2,okay president trump let’s give vice president biden a chance to respond and then we’re going to move on to the next section,second,2
Donald Trump,you don’t know the law joe,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden your response,second,2
Joe Biden,know the law what he’s telling you is simply not true check it out,second,2
Donald Trump,well check it out they don’t come back,second,2
Joe Biden,check it out,second,3
mediator_2,all right let’s move on to the next section,second,2
Donald Trump,but we don’t have to worry about it because they terminated it so we don’t have to worry about it anymore joe,second,1
mediator_2,let’s move on to the next section,second,2
Joe Biden,that’s right and you 525 kids not knowing where in god’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents,second,2
Donald Trump,go ahead,second,2
mediator_2,all right let’s talk about our next section which is race in america and i want to talk about the way black and brown americans experience race in this country part of that experience is something called the talk it happens regardless of class and income parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted including by the police for no reason other than the color of their skin mr vice president in the next two minutes i want you to speak directly to these families do you understand why these parents fear for their children,second,2
Joe Biden,i do i do my daughter is a social worker and she’s written a lot about this she has her graduate degree from the university of pennsylvania in social work and one of the reasons why i ended up working on the east side of wilmington delaware which is 90 africanamerican was to learn more about what was going on i never had to tell my daughter if she’s pulled over make sure she puts… for a traffic stop “put both hands on top of the wheel and don’t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you” but a black parent no matter how wealthy or how poor they are has to teach their child “when you’re walking down the street don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street,second,2
Joe Biden,making sure that you in fact if you get pulled over just yes sir no sir hands on top of the wheel because you are in fact the victim whether you’re a person making 300000 … child of a 300000 a year person or someone who’s on food stamps the fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in america and we have always said we’ve never lived up to it that we hold these truths to be selfevident all men and women are created equal well guess what we have never ever lived up to it but we’ve always constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion not exclusion this is the first president to come along and says that’s the end of that we’re not going to do that anymore we have to provide for economic opportunity better education better healthcare better access to schooling better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses all the things we can do and i’ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things just to give people a shot it’s about accumulating the ability to have wealth as well as it is to be free from violence,second,2
mediator_2,president trump same question to you and let me remind you of the question i would like you to speak directly to these families do you understand why these parents fear for their children,second,2
Donald Trump,yes i do and again he’s been in government 47 years he never did a thing except in 1994 when he did such harm to the black community and they were called … and he called them superpredators and he said that he said it superpredators and they never lived that down 1994 your crime bill the superpredators nobody has done more for the black community than donald trump and if you look with the exception of abraham lincoln possible exception but the exception of abraham lincoln nobody has done what i’ve done criminal justice reform obama and joe didn’t do it i don’t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it they might’ve wanted to do it but if you had to see the arms i had to twist to get that done it was not a pretty picture and everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office they cried in the oval office,second,2
Donald Trump,two weeks later they’re out saying “gee we have to defeat him” criminal justice reform prison reform opportunity zones with tim scott a great senator from south carolina he came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones it’s one of the most successful programs people don’t talk about it tremendous investment is being made biggest beneficiary the black and hispanic communities and then historically black colleges and universities after three years of coming to the office i love some of those guys they were great they came into the office and i said “what are you doing” after three years i said “why do you keep coming back” because we have no funding” i said “you don’t have to come back every year” “we have to come back”,second,4
Donald Trump,because president obama would never give them longterm funding and i did 10 year longterm funding and i gave them more money than they asked for because i said “i think you need more” and i said “the only bad part about this is i may never see you again” because i got very friendly with them and they like me and i like them but i saved historically black colleges and universities,second,2
mediator_2,okay and we’re going to talk about both of your records but your response to that vice president,second,2
Joe Biden,my response to that is i never ever said what he accused me of saying the fact of the matter is in 2000 though after the crime bill had been in the law for awhile this is a guy who said “the problem with the crime bill there’s not enough people in jail there’s not enough people in jail” and go on my website get the quote the date when he said it “not enough people” he talked about marauding gangs young gangs and the people who are going to maraud our cities this is a guy who in the central park five five innocent black kids he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty none of them were guilty of the crimes they were suggested look and granted he did in fact let 20 people … he commuted 20 people’s sentences,second,2
Joe Biden,we commuted over 1000 people’s sentences over 1000 the very law he’s talking about is a law that in fact initiated by barack obama and secondly we’re in a situation here where the federal prison system was reduced by 38000 people under our administration and one of those things we should be doing there should be no no minimum mandatories in the law that’s why i’m offering 20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts no one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem they should be going to rehabilitation not to jail we should fundamentally change the system and that’s what i’m going to do,second,2
Donald Trump,but why didn’t he do it four years ago why didn’t you do that four years ago even less than that why didn’t you when you vice president you keep talking about all these things you’re going to do and you’re going to do this but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing,second,1
Joe Biden,we did,second,2
Donald Trump,you know joe i ran because of you i ran because of barack obama because you did a poor job if i thought you did a good job i would’ve never run i would’ve never run i ran because of you i’m looking at you now you’re a politician i ran because of you,second,2

mediator_2,mr president you’ve described the black lives matter movement as a symbol of hate you’ve shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters you’ve said that black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired what do you say to americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife,second,2
Donald Trump,well you have to understand the first time i ever heard of black lives matter they were chanting “pigs in a blanket” talking about police pigs pigs talking about our police “pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon” i said “that’s a horrible thing” and they were marching down the street and that was my first glimpse of black lives matter i thought it was a terrible thing as far as my relationships with all people i think i have great relationships with all people i am the least racist person in this room,second,2
mediator_2,what do you say to americans who are concerned by that rhetoric crosstalk 00000758,second,2
Donald Trump,i don’t know i mean i don’t know what to say i got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and opportunity zones,second,2
Donald Trump,… got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and opportunity zones i took care of black colleges and universities i don’t know what to say they can say anything i mean they can say anything it’s a very… makes me sad because i am the least racist person i can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark but i don’t care who’s in the audience i’m the least racist person in this room,second,1
mediator_2,okay vice president biden let me ask you very quickly and then i have a followup question for you,second,2
Joe Biden,abraham lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history he pours fuel on every single racist fire every single one started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s getting rid of those mexican rapists he’s ban muslims because they’re muslims he has moved around and made everything worse across the board he says to… about the proud boys last time we were on stage here he said “i tell them to stand down and stand ready” come on this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn,second,0
mediator_2,president trump i’m going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then i have a followup question,second,2
Donald Trump,no he made a reference to abraham lincoln where did that come in i mean,second,1
Joe Biden,you said you’re abraham lincoln,second,2
Donald Trump,… where did that… no,second,2
Joe Biden,you said,second,2
Donald Trump,i said “not since abraham lincoln has anybody done what i’ve done for the black community”,second,3
Joe Biden,and i’m saying,second,2
Donald Trump,i didn’t say “i’m abraham lincoln” i said “not since abraham lincoln has anybody done what i’ve done for the black community” now you have done nothing other than the crime bill which put,second,2
Joe Biden,oh god,second,1
Donald Trump,tens of thousands of black men mostly in jail,second,2
Joe Biden,not true,second,2
mediator_2,all right let me ask vice president biden a question,second,2
Donald Trump,and you know what they remember it because if you look at what’s happening with the voting right now they remember that you treated them very very badly just take a look at what’s happening out there,second,2
mediator_2,let me ask vice president biden about… vice president biden let me give you a chance to respond within this context crime bills that you supported in the ’80s and ’90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession they are sons they are brothers they are fathers they are uncles whose families are still to this day some of them suffering the consequences so speak to those families why should they vote for you,second,2
Joe Biden,one of the things is that in the ’80s we passed 100 percent all 100 senators voted for a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs it was a mistake i’ve been trying to change since then particularly the portion on cocaine that’s why i’ve been arguing that in fact we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense they should be going into treatment across the board that’s what we should be spending money and that’s why i set up drug courts which were never funded by our republican friends they should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem they should be going into treatment that’s what we’ve been trying to do that’s what i’m going to get done because i think the american people have now seen that in fact it was a mistake to pass those laws relating to drugs but they were not in the crime bill,second,1
mediator_2,crosstalk 001104,second,2
Donald Trump,but why didn’t he get it done see it’s all talk no action with these politicians why didn’t he get it “that’s what i’m going to do when i become president” you were vice president along with obama as your president your leader for eight years why didn’t you get it done you had eight years to get it done now you’re saying you’re going to get it done because you’re all talking and no action joe,second,1
mediator_2,your response,second,2
Joe Biden,we got a lot of it done we released 38000,second,2
Donald Trump,you didn’t get anything done,second,1
Joe Biden,we got 38000 prisoners crosstalk 001130,second,2
Donald Trump,you got nothing done,second,1
Joe Biden,38000 prisoners were released from federal prison we have… there were over a thousand people who were given clemency inaudible 000338 in fact were the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing how they’re conducting themselves i could go on but we began the process we lost an election that’s why i’m running to win back that election and change his terrible policy,second,2
Donald Trump,i just have,second,2
mediator_2,your response and then we’re going to move on to climate change,second,2
Donald Trump,… one question why didn’t you do it in the eight years a short time ago why didn’t you do it you just said “i’m going to do that i’m going to do this” you put tens of thousands of mostly black young men in prison now you’re saying you’re going to get… you’re going to undo that why didn’t you get it done you had eight years with obama you know why joe because you’re all talk and no action,second,2
Joe Biden,crosstalk 00001223,second,2
mediator_2,all right vice president biden and then we’re going to move on to the next section,second,2
Joe Biden,we had a republican congress that’s the answer,second,2
mediator_2,okay,second,2
Donald Trump,well you got to talk them into it joe sometimes you got to talk them into it,second,2
mediator_2,we’re going to move on to our next section which is climate change,second,2
Donald Trump,… like i did with criminal justice reform i had to talk democrats into it,second,2
Joe Biden,you did what we already had done,second,2
mediator_2,gentlemen we’re running out of time so we got to get onto climate change please you both have very different visions on climate change president trump you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector vice president biden you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs for each of you how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time starting with you president trump you have two minutes uninterrupted,second,2
Donald Trump,so we have the trillion trees program we have so many different programs i do love the environment but what i want is that cleanest crystal clear water the cleanest air we have the best lowest number in carbon emissions which is a big standard that i noticed obama goes with all the time not joe i haven’t heard joe use the term because i’m not sure he knows what it represents or means but i have heard obama use it and we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration we are working so well with industry but here’s what we can’t do look at china how filthy it is look at russia look at india it’s filthy the air is filthy the paris accord 00001355 i took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly,second,2
Donald Trump,when they put us in there they did us a great disservice they were going to take away our businesses i will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs thousands and thousands of companies because of the paris accord it was so unfair china doesn’t kick in until 2030 russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away it would have been… it would have destroyed our businesses so you ready we have done an incredible job environmentally we have the cleanest air the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we’ve seen in many many years,second,0
mediator_2,vice president biden,second,2
Donald Trump,and we haven’t destroyed our industries,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden two minutes to you uninterrupted,second,2
Joe Biden,climate change global warming is an existential threat to humanity we have a moral obligation to deal with it and we’re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don’t have much time we’re going to pass the point of no return within the next 8 to 10 years four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate to clean up… to limit the emissions will put us in a position where we’re going to be in real trouble here’s where we have a great opportunity i was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as the labor the people worried about jobs to support my climate plan,second,2
Joe Biden,because what it does it will create millions of new good paying jobs we’re going to invest in for example 500000… excuse me 50000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market of the future in the meantime china is doing that we’re going to be in a position where we’re going to see to it that we’re going to take 4 million existing buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don’t leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of…,second,3
Joe Biden,so they don’t leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs by the way the whole idea of what this is all going to do it’s going to create millions of jobs and it’s going to clean the environment our health and our jobs are at stake that’s what’s happening and what right now by the way wall street firms indicated that my plan my plan will in fact create 186 million jobs 7 million more than his this is from wall street and i’ll create 1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does not on climate just on economy,second,3
mediator_2,president trump your response,second,2
Donald Trump,they came out and said very strongly 6500 will be taken away from families under his plan that his plan is an economic disaster if you look at what he wants to do if you look at his plan his,second,1
Joe Biden,crosstalk 001656,second,2
Donald Trump,… his environmental plan do you know developed it aoc plus three they know nothing about the climate i mean she’s got a good line of stuff but she knows nothing about the climate and they’re all hopping through hoops for aoc plus three look their real plan cost a hundred trillion dollars if we had the best year in the history of our country for a hundred years we would not even come close to a number like that when he says buildings they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows as far as they’re concerned if you had no window it would be a lovely thing,second,1
Donald Trump,this is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen and this wasn’t done by smart people this wasn’t done by anybody frankly i don’t even know how it can be good politically they want to spend a hundred trillion dollars that’s their real number he’s trying to say it was six it’s a hundred trillion dollars they want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny small windows and many other things,second,0
mediator_2,okay,second,2
Donald Trump,and many other things and many other things,second,2
mediator_2,okay let me have the vicepresident respond,second,2
Donald Trump,it is crazy,second,2
mediator_2,we’re running out of time and we have a lot more questions to get back to,second,1
Donald Trump,you’ll destroy our country,second,1
mediator_2,so let’s hear from the vice president i have a number of more question,second,2
Joe Biden,i don’t know where he comes from i don’t know where he comes up with these numbers,second,1
mediator_2,queens,second,2
Joe Biden,a hundred trillion dollars give me a break this plan has been endorsed by every major every major environmental group and every labor group labor because they know the future lies the future lies in us being able to breathe and they know they’re good jobs and getting us there,second,3
Joe Biden,by the way the fastest growing industry in america is the electric excuse me solar energy and wind he thinks wind causes cancer windmills it’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages 45 50 bucks an hour we can grow and we can be cleaner if we go the route i’m proposing,second,2
mediator_2,president trump,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me,second,2
mediator_2,please respond and then i have his follow up,second,2
Donald Trump,we are energy independent for first time we don’t need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy we are energy independent i know more about wind than you do it’s extremely expensive kills all the birds it’s very intermittent it’s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both germany and china and the fumes coming up if you’re a believer in carbon emission the fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we’re talking about with natural gas which is very clear,second,2
Donald Trump,one other thing solar,second,2
Joe Biden,find me a scientist who says that,second,2
Donald Trump,i love solar but solar doesn’t quite have it yet it’s not powerful yet to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world,second,2
Joe Biden,false,second,1
Donald Trump,it’s all a pipe dream but you know what we’ll do we’re going to have the greatest economy in the world but if you want to kill the economy get rid of your oil industry you want and what about fracking,second,2
mediator_2,let me,second,2
Donald Trump,now we have to ask him about fracking,second,2
mediator_2,let me allow the vice president biden to respond,second,2
Joe Biden,i never said i oppose fracking,second,2
Donald Trump,you said it on tape,second,2
Joe Biden,show the tape put it on your website,second,2
Donald Trump,i’ll put it on,second,2
Joe Biden,put it on the website the fact of the matter is he’s flat lying,second,1
mediator_2,would you rule out about banning fracking,second,2
Joe Biden,i do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need we need other industries to transition to get to ultimately a complete zero emissions by 2025 what i will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking capture the emissions from gas we can do that and we can do that by investing money in doing it but it’s a transition to that,second,2
mediator_2,i have one more question in this pile then,second,2
Donald Trump,excuse me he was against fracking he said it i will show that to you tomorrow,second,2
Joe Biden,good,second,3
Donald Trump,i am against fracking until he got the nomination he went to pennsylvania then he said “but you know what pennsylvania” he’ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it,second,2
Joe Biden,fracking on federal land i said no fracking andor oil on federal land,second,2
mediator_2,let me ask this final question in this section and then i want to move on to our final section president trump people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants in texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities why should these families give you another four years in office,second,2
Donald Trump,the families that we’re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money more money than they’ve ever made if you look at the kind of numbers that we’ve produced for hispanic for black for asian it’s nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them to put it nicely nine times more,second,3
Donald Trump,now somebody lives i have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you’re saying but they’re making a tremendous amount of money economically we saved it and i saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic we saved it,second,3
Donald Trump,say what you want to bet relationship we got saudi arabia mexico and russia to cut back way back we saved our oil industry and now it’s very vibrant again and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline remember that,second,3
mediator_2,vice president biden your response and then we’re going to have a final question for both of you,second,2
Joe Biden,my response is that those people live on what they call fence lines he doesn’t understand this they live near chemical plants that in fact pollute chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute,second,1
Joe Biden,i used to live near that when i was growing up in claymont delaware and there are more oil refineries in marcus hook and the delaware river than there is any place including in houston at the time when my mom get in the car and when there are first frost to drive me to school turning the windshield wiper there’d been oil slick in the window that’s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer the fact is those frontline communities it’s not a matter of what you’re paying them it matters how you keep them safe what do you do you impose restrictions on the pollutions that if the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities,second,2
mediator_2,okay i have one final question called,second,2
Donald Trump,would he close down the oil industry,second,2
mediator_2,it falls,second,1
Donald Trump,would you close dow the oil industry,second,2
Joe Biden,by the way i have a transition from the old industry yes,second,2
Donald Trump,oh that’s a big statement,second,2
Joe Biden,i will transition it is a big statement,second,2
Donald Trump,that’s a big statement,second,2
Joe Biden,because i would stop,second,2
mediator_2,why would you do that,second,1
Joe Biden,because the oil industry pollutes significantly,second,1
Donald Trump,oh i see okay,second,2
Joe Biden,here’s the deal,second,2
Donald Trump,that’s a big statement,second,2
Joe Biden,well if you let me finish the statement because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time over time and i’d stopped giving to the oil industry i’d stop giving them federal subsidies you won’t get federal subsidies to the gas oh excuse me to solar and wind,second,1
Donald Trump,yeah,second,3
Joe Biden,why are we giving it to oil industry,second,1
Donald Trump,we actually give it to solar and wind that’s maybe the biggest statement in terms of business that’s the biggest statement,second,3
mediator_2,okay,second,2
Donald Trump,because basically what he’s saying is,second,2
mediator_2,we have one final question mr president,second,2
Donald Trump,… he is going to destroy the oil industry will you remember that texas will you remember that pennsylvania oklahoma,second,2
mediator_2,okay vice president biden let me give you 10 seconds,second,2
mediator_2,okay,second,2
Donald Trump,remember that pennsylvania oklahoma is,second,2
mediator_2,vice president biden let me give you 10 seconds to respond,second,2
Donald Trump,ohio,second,2
mediator_2,… and then i have to get to the final question vice president biden,second,2
Joe Biden,he takes everything out of context but the point is look we have to move toward net zero emissions the first place to do that by the year 2035 is in energy production by 2050 totally,second,1
mediator_2,all right one final question to both of you,second,2
Donald Trump,is he going to get china to do it,second,2
mediator_2,no we’re finished with this,second,0
Donald Trump,is he going to get china to do it,second,2
mediator_2,we have to move onto our final question,second,2
Joe Biden,no i’m going to rejoin paris accord and make china abide by what they agreed to,second,1
Donald Trump,crosstalk 002431,second,2
mediator_2,all right this is about leadership gentlemen and this first question does go to you president trump imagine this is your inauguration day what will you say in your address to americans who did not vote for you you’ll each have one minute starting with you mr trump,second,2
Donald Trump,we have to make our country totally successful as it was prior to the plague coming in from china now we’re rebuilding it and we’re doing record numbers 114 million jobs in a short period of time et cetera but i will tell you go back,second,2
Donald Trump,before the plague came in just before i was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me they wanted to get together we had the best black unemployment numbers in the history of our country hispanic women asian people with diplomas with no diplomas mit graduates number one in the class everybody had the best numbers and you know what the other side wanted to get together they wanted to unify,second,3
Donald Trump,success is going to bring us together we are on the road to success but i’m cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything he will kill it if he gets in you will have a depression the likes of which you’ve never seen your 401ks will go to hell and it’ll be a very very sad day for this country,second,1
mediator_2,all right vice president biden same question to you what will you say during your inaugural address to americans who did not vote for you,second,2
Joe Biden,i will say i’m an american president i represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me and i’m going to make sure that you’re represented i’m going to give you hope we’re going to move we’re going to choose science over fiction we’re going to choose hope over fear we’re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities enormous opportunities to make things better,second,3
Joe Biden,we can grow this economy we can deal with the systemic racism at the same time we can make sure that our economy is being run and moved and motivated by clean energy creating millions of new jobs that’s the fact that’s what we’re going to do and i’m going to say as i said at the beginning what is on the ballot here is the character of this country decency honor respect treating people with dignity making sure that everyone has an even chance and i’m going to make sure you get that you haven’t been getting it the last four years,second,3
mediator_2,all right i want to thank you both for a very robust hour and a half a fantastic debate really appreciate it president trump former vice president joe biden thank you to belmont university for hosting us tonight and most importantly thank you to those watching tonight election day is november 3rd don’t forget to vote thank you everyone and have a great night,second,4
